1: "Now Sir hon’ble Members will recall that the Bill was introduced in the House of the people on the 2nd September 1953. It has had a long history and in one form or another it has been before the public since the end of 1949. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons the various stages through which the Bill has passed since 1946 have been summarised and I need not recapitulate on this occasion the circumstances in which the then Government of India took the decision in early 1946 to initiate an enquiry into the reform of our company law. I would remind hon’ble Members that between 1946 and 1948 the entire field of company law was carefully reviewed by two distinguished company lawyers who were appointed to recommend the broad lines on which the present Act should be revised. Their recommendations were examined in the then Ministry of Commerce and certain tentative departmental views which emerged were circulated in a comprehensive memorandum to all recognised trade and industrial associations BAR associations the High Courts and the State Governments. That brought us to the end of 1949. Many representations on this memorandum were duly received from Chambers of Commerce trade and industrial associations State Governments and the general public. At the end of 1950 the Government of India appointed a Committee under the Chairmanship of Shri Bhabha to go into the entire question of the revision of the Companies Act with particular reference to its bearing on the development of trade and industry in this country. This Committee examined a large number of witnesses in many parts of the country and submitted its report in March 1952. This report again was circulated to all State Governments Chambers of Commerce Trade Associations High Courts and many other bodies. At the same time a Special Officer was appointed in the Department of Economic Affairs Ministry of Finance to examine the report in the light of the views received from the interested public and to submit proposals to Government for the revision of the present Act. The Bill now before the House is based largely on the recommendations of the Company Law Committee modified in a few particulars. Hon’ble Members will notice that so far as public relations go the Bill has covered adequate ground. In a measure like the Companies Bill however which covers the entire field of the operation of joint stock companies the limits of consultation and discussion can never be exhausted and I would like to inform hon’ble Members that although the Bill was introduced in Parliament over seven months ago our officers have been engaged throughout this period in further studies and informal discussions with the interests concerned and on occasion I have also participated in such discussions. I have also given some further thought to some of the issues arising out of the Bill and I propose at the appropriate stage to bring before the Select Committee any changes in the provisions of the Bill which seem to me to be worthy of consideration in the light of this further examination. No hon’ble Members will have noticed that the Bill contains 6 clauses and 12 schedules. I think it is probably one of the longest legislative measures in recent legislative history. But its size might be regarded as misleading unless I make a few comments. The Bill is both one must remember a consolidating and amending measure. As mentioned in the Statement of Objects and Reasons this is the first opportunity which has occurred since 1923 for the consolidation of the Companies Act. Advantage has been taken of this opportunity to redraft several long and complicated sections in the present Act which have been split up into a large number of clauses. This is the largest single factor accountable for the increase in the number of clauses in the Bill. New clauses embodying substantial changes in the present law would hardly constitute more than a small fraction of the Bill. I would also draw attention to the structural changes in the Bill to which a reference has been made in the Statement of Objects and Reasons. The redraft of the Bill and the rearrangement of the existing chapters in the companies Act in a more logical order have I think resulted in a noticeable improvement in the form of the Bill and I hope will facilitate better understanding and appreciation of the scheme. I wish that the Act which came into effect long ago was implemented properly. I know that the Minister here is very earnest in implementing it but unfortunately his colleagues at the State level are disappointing him. Unfortunately no steps have been taken for trimming or toning up the administration at the State level and at the district level. They have to be taken immediately.",
2: "I should like now to make a few observations on the Budget. This Budget marks a turning point in the history of our country. It is no use attempting as some of my friends have done either to deprecate the budget very strongly or to suggest that we are not witnessing a new revolution in our methods of fiscal training and technique. I want it to be quite clearly pointed out to my friends that we are now facing the lean years of Indian finance. Hitherto we had revenue surpluses which were a form of public saving and which were meant to be utilised for capital development. Hereafter this form of revenue surplus would not be available. We have therefore to find out ways and means of implementing our great programme of national reconstruction at minimum cost. My point is that the deficit on revenue account would be of the order of about Rs. 19 to 20 crores. Here let me point out that I do not agree with those of my friends in the Finance Department who have attempted to suggest that Rs. 9 or 18 crores which are obtained from Pakistan should be put to the revenue side of the budget; they are to be put on the capital side. But that does not seriously alter the trend of my argument. What I am suggesting is that we would have to be prepared for a deficit of a much higher order even on the revenue side. That itself should make us realise that there are very many problems which we have to face and that we have to undertake ways and means of increasing the resources of our country so that it might be possible for us to have a greater amount of surplus or a greater amount of public saving for the purpose of financing capital development. The Finance Minister in the course of his speech Mr. Deputy Minister pointed out that the deficits during the past two years were of the order of Rs. 83 crores. I venture humbly to disagree with him because I feel that when we are talking of deficits we must take into account the overall deficit incurred by the Central Government and that would be of the order of Rs. 200 crores. During the years of relatively light expenditure we had a shortfall of about Rs. 200 crores. Undoubtedly now when we are going to have a very great amount of expenditure we might have a greater amount of deficit and we would have to find out ways and means of trying to meet our capital expenditure. Some Members have pointed out that deficit financing is good; others have pointed out that it is poison. One hon’ble Member who preceded me pointed out that it could be taken like a tonic. Now I am not willing to enter into the merits of deficit financing or demerits of deficit financing in an academic spirit. The time has now come when we should face realities. I do suggest that we have to indulge in deficit financing because without indulging in deficit financing it would not be possible for us to indulge in capital expenditure on such a large scale. But when we are talking of the scope of deficit financing we would like to place before the House and the Finance Minister the two great limitations which face us. The first limitation that faces us is that concerning the internal price level. The hon’ble the Finance Minister referred to the cost of living. He said that he was going to keep a watch over the cost of living so that it may not shoot up within a short period and make a mess of the plans of capital development. But there is another limitation which has also to be borne in mind a limitation which has not received as much notice as it should have done in all the discussions that have taken place on deficit financing. That limitation is the external limitation or the limitation which arises on account of our balance of payments position. I think this is as important Mr. Deputy Speaker as the internal price level and I should like to elaborate that particular point a bit more because I feel that a time will shortly arrive when we might have either to reconsider our policy or might even have to leave the sterling club of which we are a member. The second serious limitation is as serious as the first. What would be the consequences of deficit financing on our balance of payments? The Finance Minister in his budget speech points out that so far as the balance of payments position is concerned they have now whether it is by accident or design a favourable balance and they have contributed about Rs. 63 crores to the dollar pool during the past six months. But the moment we indulge in deficit financing we have to be prepared for worsening of our balance of payments.",
3: "I am thankful to you for having given me this opportunity long last to say a few words on the Budget. Already much has been said and I think the Finance Minister has come in for his share of congratulations as well as criticisms. So there is not very much to say but I should like to say a few words. The increased development expenditure and the absence of any new taxation has earned for the Budget a good response even from the businessmen. I specially welcome the relief given to the middle classes by raising the exemption limit of income tax in respect of personal income. No doubt this is some relief to the middle classes. But I would request the Finance Minister if he could to raise this exemption limit from Rs. 4000 to Rs. 6000 as that would give substantial relief to the middle classes. I am indeed glad that the Taxation Enquiry Commission has been appointed with Dr. John Mathai as the Chairman and I am sure that many of the vexed problems may be solved through this Commission. At the same time I would request the Finance Minister to put off the Estate Duty Bill for the present since this Enquiry Commission has been appointed and they may go into this question. For I feel that it is not an opportune moment to put on more taxes on the people. Already as Mr. Gadgil has pointed out there are so many taxes on the people. The people are over-burdened by taxes and they are just trying to recover their stability. So in regard to Estate Duty I would ask him to consider about it. My reason for asking it to be postponed is as I have said that the people are still facing economic distress. And then our Government is not able to offer the amenities which other countries have where the Estate Duty exists such as free compulsory education for children free medical aid homes for the poor and the destitute old age pension etc. So my humble suggestion is that this point may be considered by the Taxation Enquiry Commission. I agree that there is a brighter side of the picture and that instead of continually harping on our poverty we should also see the bright side. We are making encouraging progress towards laying the foundation of a welfare state. With the co-operation of all and the implementation of the Five Year Plan I am sure Sir that we should be able to lay the foundations and fulfil the dreams of India. It is indeed encouraging to know from the Finance Minister that there is a tendency of lowering food prices all over the world and in that case the prices in our country too would be lowered. Regarding Defence for obvious security reasons I do not agree with my friends who say that the expenditure should be curtailed. It is not advisable to take any undue risks and slacken the defence arrangements. Indeed defence is one of our valuable assets although strange to say there seems to be adverse opinion in some quarters. I agree with what General Cariappa once said that God and Army are remembered only when there is trouble. The Army consists of the most disciplined and loyal set of young men. It would not be proper to effect economy in the pay of these brave officers as it would not be an incentive for the right type of young men to join the Army and it would become ineffective and inefficient. I believe already officers who were drawing Rs. 1400 as their pay are now getting only Rs. 700 and about Rs. 100 as allowance. That is they are getting about half of what they were getting before. It is very hard for those officers on field duty to establish separate establishments for their families and for their children and I would specially appeal to the Finance Minister to see that the family allowances may be restored to those officers who are on field duty. Economy in Army could be effected in other ways. There is scope for more efficient operation of defence industries which process seems slow and by purchase policy of utilising goods and stores indigenously manufactured. Preferences should be given to country-made war materials such as could be produced here and they would be cheaper than foreign-made goods. I may also suggest that the Armed Forces who are not on field service or under any operational commitments could be utilised for giving military training to the youths in schools and colleges which would teach discipline and loyalty. The University authorities should make military training as part of their compulsory education just as they have adopted social domestic and political sciences. The National Cadet Corps is already incalculating military training in some Universities such as Bombay and Calcutta. But if military training is made compulsory for our university students it will go a long way.",
4: "Sir the Essential Commodities Act was passed five years ago and when the Minister yesterday came with an amending Bill we expected that he would give us a brief report on the working of this measure for the last few years. But unfortunately we are kept in the dark in regard to the exact working of the Act and the nature of the difficulties the Minister is facing. Sir as far as I know many of the provisions of this enactment have been observed more in violation by his agents at the State level. The Food Minister may be very earnest may be very able and may be very anxious to see that the various provisions of the Act are implemented in the most effective manner at the State level but unfortunately his agents at the State level are not equally enthusiastic or equally anxious to observe the provisions of this enactment. The most important objectives of this enactment are to control the supply and distribution of commodities and to maintain a stable price level. In regard to both these aspects I am afraid that the Government has failed to realise the objectives in view. Some time past when there was scarcity of foodgrains attempts were made to make procurement from certain wholesale merchants and from rice mills. In my own State I know of many instances of such procurement where after making known that certain things had to be done and certain steps had to be taken by the merchant community nothing was done later on by the Government when they found that these very orders of the Government were violated. As a result of the violations there was a consequent rise in the prices of foodgrains. In respect of other commodities like iron and steel paper etc. we see a lot of speculative activities but the provisions of the Act have not been brought to bear on them. Perhaps no case of prosecution was launched against those people who contravened the various provisions of the Act. We are interested to know in how many cases the Government have taken steps to prosecute individuals who have violated the various sections of the Act. The Minister said that the powers under the Act were not adequate. We sympathise with the Food Minister but I want to know what action has been taken in this regard by the various State Governments. In regard to the amending provision I want to know from the Minister what would be his difficulty even if minor offences are taken to courts of law. For instance the Motor Vehicles Act deals with various offences both major and minor and various minor offences under the Act are taken to courts and people are prosecuted. What is the difficulty in taking these cases of a minor nature to courts of law? There the people will have some safety that they will get a hearing and if the offences are really offences then they would be prosecuted. Otherwise they will be acquitted. Here the Minister says that there should be a security deposit. If there is a violation of a particular provision of the enactment then the executive authority will have the power either to confiscate a part of the amount or the whole of the amount. We are clothing the executive authority with more powers. I do not grudge giving powers to the executive authority provided they are used properly and effectively and in a most fair manner. But unfortunately there have been discriminations apart from the ineffectiveness of the various provisions. Wherever these provisions were used there had been discriminatory use of these provisions against a few or in favour of a few. Normally when officers are clothed with more powers there is a large scope for corruption. I feel that it would be desirable to avoid such malpractices and it would be desirable I think that even for minor offences the parties should have a chance to defend their actions. I do not think that this problem of dealing with minor offences will become complex or complicated in any way if we take them to courts of law. I want a reply from the Minister in what way he is suffering from a handicap in dealing with minor offences or offences of a technical nature. The hon’ble Member made the point that even if this thing was acceptable to the House he did not know what amount would be demanded as security. So the Minister should tell us what amount is normally expected from a licensee in all cases and what the offences are which are of a technical or minor nature which he has in view. We are not told which are major offences and which are minor offences. Clarifications on these points are necessary. I wish that the Act which came into effect long ago was implemented properly. I know that the Minister here is very earnest in implementing it but his colleagues at the State level and at the Central level are disappointing him.",
5: "The Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 was good so far as it went. But unfortunately the spirit of it could not be understood or appreciated by the common man in this country. So a new orientation of this policy was given. And the hon’ble Prime Minister after his return from China publicly declared that the future policy of the country or rather the future pattern of society will be the socialist pattern. That was further emphasised by the resolution passed at the Avadi session of the congress and later reiterated by Shri Dhebar President of the Indian National Congress. I am very glad to say that the spirit of it has been caught by the nation today. If I may say so the nation has taken up the challenge for securing the socialist pattern of society. It behoves all sections both inside this House as well as outside without having mutual recriminations to try and propagate in a sincere manner and establish the socialist pattern of society indicated by the statements of the great leaders of our country. It may be relevant and pertinent if I refer to a few sentences from the memorandum presented on the 4th June 1939 by our Prime Minister who was the Chairman of the All India Planning Committee which came into existence when there was provincial autonomy in the provinces. On pages 39 and 40 of that report he stated: It is clear that the drawing up of a comprehensive national plan becomes clearly an academic exercise with no relation to reality unless the planning authority or those to whom it is responsible are in a position to give effect to the plan. If this authority is powerless or circumscribed or restricted and has limited activities it cannot plan. An essential pre-requisite for planning is thus complete freedom and independence for the country and removal of all outside control. This implies that the country possesses in itself full sovereign authority to take any measures adopt any policies and form any relations with other countries as may seem best to its governing authority in the interests of the country and its people. National independence is thus an indispensable preliminary for taking all the steps that might be found necessary for carrying out the five year plan in all its various aspects throughout the whole country. At the present moment it is clear that not only have we in India no national independence but we are hedged in and obstructed by numerous restrictions limitations safeguard and reservations which block the path to planning and progress. Our plan for national development must therefore be drawn up for a free and independent India. Thanks to the sacrifices made by millions of our countrymen and country-women under the leadership of the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi we have today secured complete sovereign political independence at a time when the nations of the world were engaged in the bitterest struggle using all the weapons of destruction. If therefore we have secured political independence during the period of a quarter of a century it should not be difficult especially when we are today masters in our own country to secure a socialist pattern of society as has already been indicated. But it requires the assistance the propaganda the active work of all those who are interested in this. I am sure so long as my hon’ble friends the Minister the Deputy Minister and the other Minister who represent the Commerce and Industry Ministry can give us an assurance that the capitalist pattern would be avoided some of us who believe in a cent per cent socialist democracy give an undertaking that certainly totalitarian policy will not be introduced in this country because we have believed all along during the fight that we have given to the British Government when we secured political independence that we shall try to maintain democracy undiluted and a socialist democracy at that. I am absolutely certain that in this country of ours liberty of thought liberty of speech and liberty of action will be guaranteed to every citizen to express his views in the manner he pleases. I therefore assure my hon’ble friend that so long as we do not in the garb of a socialist pattern support a capitalist system India will stand hundred per cent for a socialist democracy. Now luckily for us the Fundamental Rights of the Constitution have declared that a citizen would be assured of many of the social amenities which will give reasonable comfort from the womb to the grave. But mere enunciation as I have said many times will not satisfy the common man unless the saying is put into effect. I am absolutely certain therefore that so long as there is a determination on the part of our countrymen we will be in a position to secure a socialist pattern of society. It is not even possible to draw up a plan on any other basis.",
6: "There has been some reference to the improvement in our economic situation also. We find that we have made good progress in production. We were faced equally with a difficult situation so far as cloth was concerned. There was a deficit of food and there was also shortage of cloth. I do remember the scenes that we had to witness in several cities where people had to stand in queues for hours together for two yards of very ordinary cloth but now the situation is quite changed. We have produced much cloth and we are in a position to export cloth. During the British period we were required to import cloth but now we are in a position to export cloth. After partition we were faced with the question of raw material namely cotton. We had cotton mills but cotton remained in Pakistan. Even that problem has been solved. We had placed before us a target for more production of cotton and not only has that target been achieved but it has been achieved in shorter period to the satisfaction of all people in the country. From this survey Sir you will find that everybody should be convinced that we are making good progress in the realisation of the objectives of the Five Year plan. Then there is a reference that in several essential commodities we have got increased production. This cannot be denied. In spite of this increased production I must admit we have not been able to solve the question of unemployment but efforts are being made to ease the situation so far as this question is concerned. The main thing to which I would like to refer is that the President was pleased to say and say very plainly that so far as cottage industries were concerned we have not been able to make good progress. As a matter of fact very little progress has been made. If in this country we have to solve the question of unemployment we must take and take very seriously to the development of cottage industries. That alone will solve this problem of unemployment. We want to increase production but we want to take to such means for increasing our production as would be man-absorbing and not man-saving as have been resorted to by the western countries. That alone will solve our problem to a great extent. If we organise our cottage industries if we take to the spirit of Swadeshi I have no doubt we will solve the problem of unemployment to a great extent. Then Sir a reference has been made to certain additional projects which have been included in the Five Year Plan. There was a great demand from Maharashtra to include this project in the Five Year Plan. A couple of years ago there was a conference presided over by my colleague from the district the present Revenue Minister of Maharashtra. He had presided over it and there was a unanimous demand supported by practically the entire people from Maharashtra that this project should be included in the Five Year Plan. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Government of India and the Government of Maharashtra for having seen to it that this project in Maharashtra is included in the Five Year Plan. The President’s Address makes reference to the improvement of our transport and communications. Our increased production leads to the question of better transport facilities. The agricultural production is on the increase but Sir if there is no betterment of our transport facilities this increased production in agriculture will not benefit the agriculturist. In my part of the country even now this situation prevails. The production there is on the increase but the agriculturists are suffering on account of inadequate facilities of railway transport. I was glad to find from the President’s Address that the Railways are thinking of opening even new lines very soon. It has also been said that so far as locomotives and rolling stock are concerned the manufacture of these is going on very satisfactorily and we have made good progress in this respect during the last few years. Any nation can be proud of this achievement. Then there is a reference to the housing conditions. We can very well remember the scenes that we were required to witness immediately after partition. Thousands and tens of thousands of our brethren came to this country from Pakistan. It was a very serious question as to how to house them but the day has come when the question has practically been solved or it can at least be said that we are near the solution of the question. Seventy two crores of rupees have been spent during the last few years in constructing houses for the refugees and in this very city we are witnessing an exhibition where we can see the models of cheap and decent houses. If these cheap houses are constructed for the refugees it will provide shelter for them at a low cost.",
7: "Now I would like to say that with this measure we are now adopting to my mind it will not be possible to have this system or any other system functioning effectively. The number of clauses that we have included are so restrictive and rigid that it will not be possible for any system to function in this country. If at all it is able to function it will be able to function with a lot of difficulties. It will be said afterwards that the industrial sector particularly the private sector has not been able to deliver the goods. I would like to warn the Government that if anything happens in the future in which industrial production or production in the private sector has not gone up it would be not because of any lack of efforts on the part of the private sector but because of the measure that we are now adopting. I have mentioned several times how this particular Bill is very restrictive and how it will hamper the normal growth of companies in this country. It is a pity that when we are on the threshold of the Second Five Year Plan such a measure should be passed in this House. I would now like to make a few observations about the speeches of some of the hon’ble Members here. Shri Ashoka Mehta justifies the restrictions on managing agents by saying that managing agents are no longer the main source of finance. He also argues that profits have been high and will continue to remain high and therefore he would like to see the managing agents being paid on a sliding scale. He is in the habit of referring to a number of books and making quotations from a number of them published in America or in other countries and particularly by some of the professors. I would also like to mention to him that even when companies are floated it requires a certain amount of confidence amongst the investing public and it is because a particular firm is managing a particular company that this confidence is created in the investing public. Even there as the hon’ble Finance Minister has said there is a sort of overall tight control. New banks and insurance companies are not floated nowadays. What you have are the few banks which are existing and the few insurance companies that are existing. The other point is that the credit-worthiness of the managing agency firm does count to a certain extent in getting credit from the banks and other financial institutions. Yesterday it was mentioned by my hon’ble friend that the crux of the problem is the question of payment of remuneration to a particular managing agency system. He said that in this Bill a definite encouragement has been given to the alternative type of management namely the managing director or the manager where an individual has been permitted to take 5 per cent while in the case of the managing agency it has been permitted to take about 10 per cent. I would like to point out to him that it is not merely the question of remuneration which will decide the alternative type of management. The remuneration is not a very important thing. Unless and until you allow a certain amount of flexibility for any system to function it will not be possible to evolve any other system to take the place of the managing agency system. In spite of so many shackles you may find that those few business houses which are carrying on now may have to carry on on the present basis you may not find many new people coming in the field. Several times it has been mentioned in this House why the business community has not prescribed for itself a code of conduct. In this connection I would like to point out that a degree or diploma is essential for the profession and in case of violation of the code sanction should be provided by it to prevent a person from practising the profession. Today even Ashoka Mehta and Shri C.C. Shah can set up a grocery shop and become businessmen. Nobody lays down any condition for starting business and nobody can prevent others from continuing it but I would like to point out that with regard to the code of conduct there is a certain amount of ethics and there are certain standards and traditions on which business houses function. If a particular firm has not got proper ways of managing its business you will find that that business house will find it difficult to function and it would be difficult for it to command the confidence of the business community. It would not be possible for it to function as effectively as a firm which has proper ways of managing its business. That is sufficient as a code of conduct. It is not possible to prescribe a certain code of conduct in the manner it has been done for the profession in general.",
8: "In conclusion I would like to say a word in regard to employment with which I have been dealing so far. According to the figures supplied the number of displaced persons from Bangladesh employed through employment exchanges is only 37000. This is very meagre compared with their total number which comes to 32 lakhs according to the official figures. This is with regard to Bangladesh refugees. The number of displaced persons from Pakistan employed through employment exchanges is not very encouraging but still it is 75000. I would urge upon the hon’ble Minister to take this into consideration and see that something is done to find employment for these people. Of course there is some expenditure incurred on general education and vocational training but when we look at the number of persons who have been given vocational training we find that the number already trained and under training is only 17000. This figure also seems to be very small considering the magnitude of the problem before us. Some programmes of general improvement have been undertaken by the Government of West Bengal by way of setting up new industries etc. These programmes should be looked into and put into operation with a view to giving more employment to these displaced persons. Within the limited time at my disposal I shall limit my remarks to refugees from Bangladesh. The first thing which strikes one as one looks at the various brochures and publications that have been given to us is the amount of contradiction one has to battle against. The first contradiction is in regard to the number of persons Government think they have rehabilitated in West Bengal. Granting that it is difficult to make a final assessment of the number of refugees who have come from Bangladesh it is still true to say that at least there should be some sort of parity between what the Union Ministry says and what the West Bengal Rehabilitation Ministry says. Only a few days ago the West Bengal Minister of Rehabilitation said that there are 22 lakhs of refugees who have to be rehabilitated but the Central Government’s figures are 31 lakhs. Unless the Government know the number of people they have to budget for it is rather bewildering to know how they mean to plan in bringing about their rehabilitation. As a matter of fact many other sources believe that the figure is far higher but in any case there should be some parity and some ideas to the extent of the rehabilitation problem which still remains before the people of West Bengal. The other contradiction is this. On the one hand Shrimati Renuka Ray says that in the near future they will be making a successful completion of the work of economic rehabilitation of refugees in that State but only last year Shri A.P. Jain said that as yet the problem of the displaced persons from Bangladesh was a matter which was giving some concern. I really do not understand why in spite of Shri A.P. Jain recognising that the problem is still quite serious Shrimati Renuka Ray should have made such a statement. Yet when we heard the hon’ble Finance Minister we find that there has been a shortfall in rehabilitation budget. I think that if the Fact Finding Committee’s Report had been published the assessment that we have rehabilitated about fifty per cent of the people of Bangladesh who came over as displaced persons would have become quite clear in regard to its incorrectness. As a matter of fact when we went round the camps and colonies in West Bengal we found that as yet not more than fifteen per cent of the people have been rehabilitated in the sense that they are able to eke out their subsistence on the poorest levels. It is not more than fifteen per cent and I think the figures of the Fact Finding Committee are still lower. I think this is something that we have to take very seriously and put our minds to and apply all the resources that we have to find out how we will be able to tackle this problem of rehabilitation. Now coming to the question of relief I feel that until we are able to give really proper rehabilitation we cannot withdraw relief. It is no use arguing whether relief leads to lethargy and moral slackness. Unless our rehabilitation policies are fruitful have we any right to stave the people to death? As a matter of fact Shri A.P. Jain may know that in West Bengal the incidence of Tuberculosis amongst the refugee population is very high. Only a small percentage of them is catered for by the medical relief given by the Directorate of Rehabilitation. If I am to tell you the tragic fate of the refugees in West Bengal I would refer you to a report which appeared in February 1954.",
9: "Sir the Budget has been variously described and criticised as one that increases the burden of the common man one which gives concessions to the rich and encourages foreign investments. I agree Sir that it is all this and much more. But it certainly is not a highway man’s budget. To my mind Sir the Budget is sincere conscientious and at the same time it is a bold effort on the part of the Finance Minister who is charged with heavy responsibility of finding resources for the Third Five Year Plan. This Plan to my mind Sir is not at all ambitious in view of our needs. It may be looked upon as a rather heavy demand but looking to our needs it is not very ambitious. Sir the fact that even the considerations of the coming general elections could not deflect the Finance Minister from the course which seemed to him necessary and proper should earn him the appreciation of every right thinking man. The common man’s interest as I said is nearer to our hearts than perhaps some others can claim or at least it is equally nearer to us and yet there come times in a nation’s history when it becomes necessary for the people to postpone the fruits of their labour and enterprise to secure the future. Here also Sir opinions may differ. According to the Communist Party such a time came during the last Great War when they were exhorting people the common people to contribute their full mite to the war effort. According to us however Sir we are passing through such a time at the present moment and I have no doubt that the common people appreciate this position and will willingly tighten their belts contribute their full mite and will surely return the Congress to power having full confidence in the future and looking to a future where their posterity will be assured of a far better social and economic order. Who Sir does not sympathise with the difficulties of the common man? As a matter of fact most of us come from that class and I am sure the Finance Minister would have liked to do away with some of the levies. None would have been happier if he could have done without these new levies but there are Sir certain very imperative limitations. We are passing through a critical period. Sir it may not be necessary to continue these levies for a long time; rather I am inclined to think that before long it may be possible to give up some of them at least. I have very valid reasons to think so. Our public undertakings are coming to their own and some of our important irrigation and power projects have just been completed. Some others are nearing completion and in due course. I think in the very near future they must yield returns. This will go a long way to lighten the burden of the common man. We might Sir also resort to some other ways. I suggest that we might take to public trading in some specific items of export and import. That would also certainly go a long way and help us. The private corporate sector has been steadily growing and has been developing capacity. It is sure to benefit from all these present concessions and develop greater capacity. This sector must come forward to meet new demands for taxation in the future. I agree that so far as indirect taxation is concerned it has reached the saturation point but the corporate sector growing as it is in strength in vitality and in capacity will not I am sure shirk its responsibility to contribute to the common fund. I wish Sir the committee which had been appointed to go into where the additional national income had gone had entered upon its labours a bit earlier and had made its findings available to us. I do not want to state its findings but I have a feeling that the committee when it concludes its labours will come to the conclusion that a major portion of this additional national income has gone into the pockets of a comparatively small number of men small number of individuals. And it is they who must in future contribute their share to the country’s taxation needs because the profits they have earned are not all due to their own efforts and enterprise only. To a very large measure they are the result of the economic policies of the Government and due to certain other circumstances to which they did not contribute anything. Therefore there is ample justification for the two taxes the capital gains tax and the excess profits tax. I need not go in details into all the reasons that my hon’ble friend has explained earlier so lucidly but I must say that I entirely agree with them all. Having said this I would like to say a few words about allocations which have been made to the various Ministries in the Budget.",
10: "In discussing the Demands for Grants of the Finance Ministry we have got to see to what extent the administration of this particular Ministry has led to the development of our national wealth and the securing of the welfare which our State claims to have in view. Madam we must try to analyse very carefully the working of this particular Ministry because it is not merely a department of the Government so to say but it is the nerve centre of the administration of the country. I would like first to refer to the role of foreign capital because in determining the manner in which the permission of capital issues has been granted by the particular administration we should keep in our mind to what extent the interests of our nation have been served. I fully endorse the statement which the previous speaker has made so far as repatriation of the investments made by foreigners and of profits are concerned. We have dealt with this topic quite a number of times and I do not want to reiterate anything apart from only supporting what the hon’ble Member who just now spoke said. I would now like to deal with the investments of foreigners in India. Madam the Government of our country accepted the proposition that in allowing foreign investment it should come in only in such industry and such form of production wherein our national investors will not come forward and in which technical skill is wanted. There is also one other factor which the industrial policy of our Government of 1948 as adumbrated further in 1949 by the Prime Minister laid down. It specifically said that the control and ownership of such concerns should as far as possible be in the hands of Indian nationals and the technical know-how of our country should be developed. I would like to emphasise the figures that have been put forward for the last few years. From 1947 till the end of 1952 or the early part of 1952 it has been reported that Rs. 19 crores of foreign capital have been allowed to be invested in our country. Of that practically more than Rs. 6 crores have been allowed to be invested in managing agency and trading enterprises in our country. So far as the Government policy is concerned we find that a sum of Rs. 4 crores has been allowed to be invested this year. We do not know how it is to be used up. We have been told that during the period 1948-53 nearly Rs. 35 lakhs have been allowed to be invested in textile machinery and generally in the textile industry. We have seen to what extent cotton and jute have been dominated by the national capital and to what extent they play the role as against the demand for them. We know further what the Government is doing in regard to these industries and how the Indian counterpart in these industries are behaving. Then why this further penetration of foreign capital? Even in regard to the expansion scheme we find that paints soaps electric fans and machine tools are some of the industries where the Government is allowed foreign interest to establish or expand their factories. It will adversely compete with the production of the country when the indigenous producers do not find any market in this sphere. Therefore we have got to see to what extent the capital issue has been regulated by this Government and particularly by the Finance Department so that the national well-being of the country could be guaranteed. Then we have got to look into the fact as to how far the new industries are allowed to function. So far as the oil refineries are concerned some of them have been established and some more are going to be established very soon. In the control of the administration the Indians have no share. There are only preference shareholders and they have now voice in the management. So far as the administrative aspect in this industry is concerned the most important part of it is the technical know-how. They do not guarantee that they will train the Indians. That means they say even after 20 years we will have to face the problem of the know-how in respect of the oil refineries. I do not know why the Government are showing softness to foreigners in this matter. Then we have another investment in collaboration with the Indian Chemical Industries for the manufacture of civil explosives. Here as far as I have gathered only 20 per cent is going to be Indian capital. The majority of the shares will remain with the Indian Chemical Industries. Nobody else has been allowed to make any investment. It would have been better if other companies and private individuals had been given an opportunity to purchase the shares.",
11: "Sir several questions raised regarding the Defence Ministry and the External Affairs and Irrigation Ministries have been clarified by my colleagues from those Ministries. My task therefore has been simplified to that extent. Before I go to the questions financial and economic raised by several hon’ble Members I should like to clarify one or two points which are more administrative than economic or financial. One of them was raised by my hon’ble friend. He raised the question about the recruitment by the Assistant Superintendents’ Departmental Competitive examination and particularly about the examination held in 1960. He said that about Rs. 6 lakhs were spent for the 1960 examination and later it was declared that no vacancies were available. He therefore suggested that a definite procedure should be there and the examination should be held according to the vacancies declared in advance and all persons who have qualified in that examination should be eligible for promotion or for appointment. Sir I do not know whether the hon’ble Member knows how these vacancies are filled. He probably refers to the Section officers’ Grade in the Central Secretariat Service. This is filled 50 per cent by direct recruitment and 25 per cent by departmental competitive examination open to the Assistants i.e. the next lower grade and the rest 25 per cent by promotion of the Assistants on the basis of seniority subject to fitness. The examination therefore that he was referring to was a departmental competitive examination for filling 25 per cent of the vacancies. It takes about one year for the Union Public Service Commission to declare the results of the examination from the time they take up the question of the examination. It is not therefore possible to declare the number of vacancies to be filled in from the very beginning. To declare them just when the results are out is more realistic and that is what is done. Sir if the examination is treated as qualifying examination the number of persons who will thus become eligible for appointment will be quite unrelated to the number of vacancies to be filled in and then the very situation which the hon’ble Member wishes to avoid would arise. It would not then be possible to hold any of the examinations at regular intervals and promotions against this quota would become very fitful. The hon’ble Member also suggested that the rules for recruitment and promotion etc. Should be uniform for all Ministries whether participating in the Central Secretariat Service Scheme or not. It must be and this is so except for the Ministry of External Affairs and the Railways. These have different rules but these rules are very much similar and there is not much difference. But because these persons are recruited for different purposes and by different agencies they are separate. Therefore his purpose in saying that there should be uniformity is almost carried out. The only difference is that the Ministry of Home Affairs does not control the services in these two Ministries. Then Sir questions were raised about backward areas and the backward States and also about the city of Calcutta. If the Budget is properly scrutinised it would be found that assistance is provided for the States particularly the backward States and the Finance Commission which assesses the overall requirements of the States takes this into consideration and makes its recommendations which are carried out every time the Finance Commission’s recommendations are received and they are received periodically according to the Constitution. Sir I would like to give the total amount paid to the States on this account. The main objective of planning is to create conditions in which living standards are raised in a sufficiently reasonable level and all citizens are given full and equal opportunity for growth and service. The plans seek to provide a balanced emphasis on increase in production and employment. The development plans are thus accepted as the means for ensuring equitable development in the field of social services. There is no reason to suppose that the needs of the less fortunate or prosperous States are being neglected. But it would not be proper to expect that all these differences could be wiped out now immediately. It must be seen whether we are going towards that very end or not. We are deliberately going towards that end and we hope and trust that in course of time these inequalities would be wiped out if not completely wiped out at any rate they would be lessened. My hon’ble friend complained about inadequate provision included in the plan for meeting the growing requirements of the city of Calcutta where even the basic services like water supply sewage disposal and drainage were not being augmented and that the Central Government was not enthusiastic about solving these difficulties.",
12: "I have no intention of giving a certificate about which my hon’ble friend Dr. Krishnaswami was talking some time ago since anything like a certificate being given by any Member of the business community is likely to be misunderstood. But the fact remains that impartial observers both here and abroad have testified to the soundness and stability of our finances which have successfully withstood severe stresses and strains of the changing economic factors both national and international and for this the fullest possible credit is due to the wise handling of the situation by our present Finance Minister. There have been criticisms on both sides. Some have described the Budget as pro-big business as something which has brought about a boom in the stock exchange and as something which has brought about satisfaction in the business circles. The fact is that if there has been any satisfaction it has been due purely to negative features of the budget and not because any positive relief in any direction has been given to business or industry. It is true that there were certain fears in the minds of the business community that in view of the expanding and growing needs of the Centre the Finance Minister might resort to certain further additional taxation and since those fears were not realised there has been some slight recovery in certain stock exchanges but that does not in the least mean that whatever relief and legitimate relief was due to the business and industrial community has received any adequate response from the Finance Minister. We have got to face the fact that we are at present engaged in the process of development. People who talk about U.K. and U.S.A conveniently forget that these are the most highly industrialised countries in the world and our taxation system so long as we are engaged in expanding and building our economy must be adjusted and linked with the requirements of the expanding economy and should not be compared with the high taxation levels that may be prevalent in U.K. and U.S.A. Friends have talked about unemployment. But whether the raising of the direct taxation levels will in any way mitigate unemployment is a question that should be considered. If the Finance Minister gives substantial relief in direct taxation I think that might lead to an acceleration in the pace of development. So it has to be considered whether it is relief in taxation which will lead to a reduction of unemployment or whether it is raising of taxation to the utmost levels which will dry up the resources and channels of capital formation and thereby not only retard all further development but might also throw the functioning of present industries out of gear. So my submission is that when the Taxation Enquiry Committee has been appointed it is only logical to expect that no substantial changes in the taxation structure will be made until the findings of that Expert Committee are known until we know the incidence of taxation in the various sectors of our economy. Now coming to the question of deficit financing I am afraid that my esteemed friend’s attitude was somewhat different from the line of opinion in the business and industrial community. Not that we advocate deficit financing bringing any artificial rise in prices but the fact is that those who have criticised deficit financing have not suggested any other alternative or made any other constructive suggestion which will bring about necessary development plans. After all the fact has got to be faced that whatever programme we have set out in the National Plan should go on unimpeded by any financial considerations. An assurance has been given by the Finance Minister that so far as financial resources are concerned he will ensure that the Five Year Plan will not in any way be retarded. In this connection I can only say that deficit financing is one thing so far as normal expenses and expenditure are concerned. Certainly nobody would advocate deficit financing which might be very undesirable. But when it is a question of doing something abnormal of investing something in productive channels then certainly some risk has got to be taken and I think the Finance Minister has been fully cautious in taking whatever measures he has so far. We know the measures that the Government took for contracting money supply about the end of 1950 and certain other measures adopted which brought about a slump. Also from time to time the Finance Minister did not hesitate to mop up the surplus which as the records would show has been about Rs. 300 crores during the past four or five years.",
13: "In the course of the debate yesterday on the Home Ministry’s Demands a number of points were raised by hon’ble Members. In particular I am happy that some Members of this House appreciated the efforts that were being made by the State Governments as also by the Centre so far as the various subjects under discussion were concerned especially so far as the law and order situation was concerned it was very good on the part of some Members to have appreciated the efforts made by the State Governments in this regard. There were a number of other points also which were raised and in respect of some of them I should like to enlighten the House so far as the real position is concerned. These points deal very briefly with Tripura the Andamans Delhi and Gujarat and they have also some bearing on the question of the Scheduled Castes the Scheduled Tribes and the Services. These therefore are the various points and I should like to place the correct picture before this House so that the House will know what Government have been doing so far as all these questions are concerned. With your permission I would deal briefly with Tripura first. When the Part C States Act was passed in view of a number of circumstances the geographical position of the State the backward nature of the State the existence of a very large number of tribal people and a number of other circumstances it was considered advisable so far as the administration of this State was concerned that it ought to be directly under the Government of India so that they can spend more for the purpose of developing this backward area. Now the question is often raised why we are not immediately introducing popular government in this tiny state the population of which is half a million. That question cannot be considered singly but will be considered in the context of the Report that we are receiving very shortly in the course of the next three or four months from the States Reorganisation Commission. The whole question will be considered. Their recommendations will be placed before the House and only then Government will take appropriate action. So far as the present regime is concerned it will also be kindly noted that it is not an autocratic rule in the popularly accepted sense of the term. Therefore I am pointing out to this House certain circumstances from which the House will gather that Government have been trying their best to improve the conditions there and to develop it to the extent that is possible. I would make a very brief reference to the expenditure during the last three years. For the year 1950-51 Government spent Rs. 95 lakhs. There is a considerable Scheduled Tribes population as also a Scheduled Castes population. Mostly they have come from Bangladesh. A sum of Rs. 17 lakhs has been set apart for the purpose of improving the condition of the Scheduled Castes as also the Scheduled Tribes. Then very great efforts are being made for the purpose of rehabilitating the refugees most of whom are from the Scheduled Castes and it will be found that as a matter of fact 190000 people have been rehabilitated in this tiny State of Tripura. Out of them 99000 and odd have been rehabilitated in Government colonies and land loans have been given facilities for education have been given and in respect of medical facilities it will be found that the amount has increased by at least five times. Then a point was made that unemployment was rising. So far as the question of unemployment is concerned it is a general question and has only a very short specific point so far as the State is concerned. You will find that in view of the development projects that Government have undertaken the number of persons employed or the service personnel in this tiny State has increased. These persons are actually under employment in respect of the different departments so far as development projects are concerned. Then you will also note that for the purpose of providing good buildings for offices especially for schools and hospitals the Government have a proposal before them which is being implemented according to which Rs. 1 crore are going to be spent for the purpose of construction of various buildings. Then we are also taking care to see that crime is not increasing at all. Very vague statements were made that crime was increasing. In fact so far as the border area is concerned there were only two dacoities and no more. Even all the offenders in respect of these offences have been brought under control.",
14: "Sir Now I would like to say something about tea. This time there is taxation on common tea the tea that we are consuming here so that there can be more earnings through export. But if we examine this tea industry we will find that we are not getting good results either by the efforts of the Tea Board or by the efforts of Government. One-fourth of the production of the whole country is represented by tea but that much of attention is not given by the Government to this industry. They think that it is already getting foreign earning and so it should continue to get it. But efforts should be made not only to develop this industry but also to improve the industry through research and other things. As you know in some parts the foreign companies which are working here are neglecting this industry. They are only after the profits they are not thinking of the development of the industry. There is room for development in many respects but it all depends upon research work and research stations should be set up wherever there is neglect. No doubt the Tea Board is there but the Tea Board is not seeing to these things. That is our complaint. In the Tea Board people are there who are not at all eager to see how this industry could be developed how we could earn more profits how the quality could be improved and how the quantity could be increased. We are not seeing to that. I come from a part where the tea industry plays an important part in the economy of that area. But I find that it is being neglected from year to year and no attention is given to it. I find that there is this drought menace in the tea plantations. As a result no further improvement in plantation is made. There the development of tea can be undertaken. I only suggest this to our Finance Minister. When you are giving relief to coffee why are you not giving relief to tea which is earning much more foreign exchange? I humbly urge our Finance Minister to see to it and remove this burden on common tea. Now I would like to say a word about betelnut. There is taxation on betelnut which is imported. In my part large quantities of betelnuts are being smuggled. So there was a representation from that area saying that betelnut should also come within the purview of customs duty and that part should be declared a port. A representation was made to the Finance Ministry as also the Commerce and Industry Ministry but nothing is done. I urge upon them to see to this whether smuggling which is giving no benefit to the Government and which is going to be increased cannot be stopped. Though our land customs department is there it cannot deal with smuggling effectively. Smuggling is going on. So if you want to stop it some definite steps should be taken and the representation which was made from that part should be given due consideration. Now some other friend also touched upon rural economy and cottage and village industries. One thing we must do. That is we must remove the disparity between the town and the village. If we are to remove it what should be done? We should develop small industries village industries and cottage industries. How can they be developed? For that power should be there. Now my hon’ble friend was saying that out of six lakhs of villages only 19000 villages have been electrified. This is meagre. If village electrification is not given due consideration we cannot make progress. When our Draft Five Year Plan was discussed among Members of Parliament I asked for information about how much of village electrification was contemplated in the Third Five Year Plan. The answer was very unsatisfactory. Unless you develop your village industries how can you advance? They are also contemplating to employ the surplus labour and also agricultural peasants who are not wholly employed to develop village industries and to make a plan. But unless power is supplied unless you have a good scheme of rural electrification how can village industries be developed in these modern days? We say big things. We say here and we shout from housetops that so much is being done for the rural areas. But actually we are not doing what should be done. If rural electrification is there then rural industries can be developed. Otherwise they cannot be developed. Unemployment cannot be solved. The only solution for unemployment is the development of small industries and cottage industries. Otherwise unemployment will increase year by year and there will be frustration among young men particularly among the educated.",
15: "Sir before the House adjourned for lunch yesterday I had started speaking on the Essential Commodities Amendment Bill. I have got here with me the Bill as introduced. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons the Government pointed out that in certain cases it might be necessary for them not to award punishment prescribed in the law as it exists at present but to forfeit a part of the deposit. This relates to minor offences under the Essential Commodities Act. I can quite understand this and generally therefore nobody would oppose this thing but the question that I wish to raise in this connection before the House is the manner in which this Act is being implemented by the Government and also by the State Governments because here is a measure which is sponsored by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and in regard to many aspects of which I believe the Central Government has concurrent jurisdiction but much is left to the States. Our experience has been especially in the State from which I come namely West Bengal that this Act is not implemented properly by the State authorities because of various connections of certain people high up with the big business and others indulging in speculation hoarding and so on. The result has been that whatever should be done had not been done. The Central Government has got powers under this Act to make rules to give directions to the States and to supervise the manner in which the particular measure is administered by the States. We found that much that should have been done was not done. What is the use of talking about the punishment of the small fry? Certainly if they are guilty they have to be punished and the smaller the fry the minor should be the punishment. I agree there but the point is that the Act is not properly implemented. We should like to know from the Government as to how many cases have been started under the Essential Commodities Act. We know that foodgrains had been hoarded speculation had been indulged in stocks had been removed from one State to another surreptitiously by unfair and illegal methods. These should have attracted the attention of the Essential Commodities Act. The Act was passed in this Parliament with a view to putting a check on speculative rise in prices. When it came to the question of practical implementation of this measure we found that the Government had failed. Now Government should say something about it. When Government seeks to amend an Act it should tell us as to how the parent Act which is proposed to be amended has been implemented. Is it the contention of the Government that difficulty arises because this particular provision is not there in the Act? Are Government in trouble because they do not know how to deal with the smaller fries? Or is it because that those who are supposed to administer this measure at the State level at the district level have thought it fit to ignore it have thought it fit to by-pass it? If any measure of the Central Government was needed for controlling the price of foodgrains and ensuring the supply of essential commodities to the community it is the Essential Commodities Act. I would like the Minister to say something on this. I know that he was not here at the time when we passed this measure nor was he there when the Essential Commodities Act was by-passed by many State Governments. In the past we had drawn the attention of the Minister to this problem and that Minister is now happily going to be the President of the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee but there I would like to ask the Minister who has stepped into his shoes as to what he is doing in order to see to the proper implementation of this Act. How many prosecutions have taken place? The small people of course should be dealt with very mildly I agree and I support the measure but taking the law as it is today without this amendment it empowers Government to deal very effectively so far as the provisions of the law go with the big traders wholesalers and profiteers. I would like to know as to how they have dealt with them. How many are in jail today? How many have paid fine? How many have suffered imprisonment? How many licences have been cancelled as a result of malpractices corruption profiteering and so on all of which are provided for under this Bill? We are entitled to know. Take us into your confidence in regard to this matter. I say from whatever knowledge we have that very few have been prosecuted under this Act. If it is so it is not because our blackmarket trade has suddenly become whitemarket trade or those impious people have suddenly become virtuous with the succession in the office of the Food Minister by a new man.",
16: "The next question that I would like to deal with is the paragraph in the President’s Address relating to the progress made in our economy in our agricultural sector in our industrial sector in our foreign trade etc. Sir you were pleased to read out to us a very large list of the achievements of the Congress Government during the last decade and the important targets which have been achieved during the last ten years of our planned economy. You also mentioned the question of increase in food production increase in the production of agricultural commodities etc. Fortunately Sir here we have in our midst the ex-Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Shri V.T. Krishnamachari who has addressed a number of meetings and seminars in New Delhi recently drawing our attention to the weakness in our agricultural sector. If the press reports are correct in one seminar he mentioned that even if all the targets of the Third Five Year Plan are achieved still at the end of the Third Five Year Plan period we may be facing a serious situation regarding the supply of agricultural commodities. He has also expressed the hope that we will be able to exceed the targets which have been fixed for the Third Five Year Plan. I do not know whether his expectation of exceeding the targets will be fulfilled or not but it is quite clear that we have not been able to give sufficient attention to the development of the agricultural sector. It has also been stated that development of the agricultural sector is one of the most difficult tasks tasks which have been found difficult both by democratic countries as well as by countries in which total planning is going on. It is all the more reason therefore that we should pay more attention to the agricultural sector so that it may be possible for us to meet our requirements as and when they arise and the situation which he has foreseen at the end of the Third Five Year Plan may not materialise. It is no use merely taking refuge behind some of the figures which have been complied and narrating the progress which has already been achieved. We are happy that some progress has been achieved but we are anxious that more progress should be there and for that purpose also certain definite steps will be taken. In this connection I am also happy to hear what the Defence Minister said yesterday in one of his public meetings namely that the Government of India is contemplating to create a set-up in our villages wherein our panchayats will be functioning more or less on the lines of Parliament. Unfortunately he did not elaborate that point further and the press has not thrown any more light on what that exactly means. But if it means that the panchayats will be in charge of the resources that are available in the villages that they will be in a position to determine how best the productive efforts in the villages are to be directed and in what direction determine what targets are to be achieved and when the production is there and there is a surplus to be exchanged with other centres in the country that the panchayats will have their say in the matter on what terms this surplus will be exchanged with other centres in the country then I think a very valuable step forward in the direction of building our economy on a decentralised basis will have been taken. We have always taken the view Sir that if planning is to succeed in our country and if there is not going to be any regimentation of our productive activity and forces what is necessary is that the common man should have a voice in determining the economic policies and in formulating the economic plans of development and should have also his say in determining on what terms a village or a group or an industry should be working for the development of economy as a whole. In other words some amount of competition some amount of bargaining power is to be generated in the lowest strata of our society and in the lowest rung of our economy so that with the help of that bargaining power under the overall influence and policy of the Planning Commission it may be possible for us to develop our economy in a manner which satisfies both the interests and the requirements of the nation as well as the aspirations of the people. When people feel that they also have their say in the formulation of policies and programmes and that such policies and programmes are not something which is dictated from New Delhi but are those which have been worked out by their own efforts and as a result of their own deliberations to that extent these plans are a part of their efforts in the development of their regions of their own crafts their own industries and their own skills.",
17: "Mr. Vice Chairman I rise to associate myself fully with the Resolution and the concern which has been expressed from all the various sections of the House regarding the urgent necessity of developing rural industries. As time passes by we are reaching a situation in our rural areas where something desperate needs to be done immediately if we want to preserve the social stability of the country and also to see that full use is made of the time and talent of the people in the rural areas which go waste today as has been pointed out in the Resolution. Sir the Planning Commission and the Government of India have applied their minds to the various isolated aspects of rural industries and some valuable reports have been published and some important recommendations have been made in these reports which need consideration. But unfortunately there is no high level decision regarding the various issues which face the country as far as the problem of rural industrialisation is concerned. We are not quite clear as to what first of all rural industries mean and what rural industrialisation implies. Does rural industrialisation mean the utilisation of local resources in order to meet the local needs? Or does rural industrialisation imply the creating of surplus in the rural areas which could be exchanged with the surplus in other centres of the country and thereby to create a richer life for the rural areas? Various opinions have been expressed with regard to this problem but there is no authoritative determination of the policy regarding the meaning of rural industrialisation. It has been suggested that if such import of capital and skill from urban centres were to mean merely the multiplication of industrial centres in the rural areas such an industrialisation of the rural areas would nullify the advantages that are likely to accrue as a result of the rural industrialisation. The time has come when some decision has to be taken as to what we really mean by this rural industrialisation. There is also difference of opinion regarding the authority that should undertake the responsibility for this rural industrialisation. From the literature that has been published in this connection it is quite obvious that two distinct and powerful schools have developed regarding this issue. On the one hand there are people who believe that the task of rural industrialisation should be entrusted to the village panchayats. Since they represent the village people and they have the resources and the powers to raise the necessary resources from the rural areas the panchayats it is felt are the competent authorities to deal with the problem of rural industrialisation. Equally strongly it has been argued by others that cooperatives are the right answer to the question as to which should be the authority that should deal with rural industrialisation. I may also mention that there is a third school which believes that the import of private capital and private skill into the work of rural industrial development is the real answer to the problem which we face in the matter of rural industrialisation. Here again some authoritative determination of the policy has become necessary because in the absence of such a policy ad hoc decisions are taken which sometimes cancel each other and therefore the rapid progress which we hope and wish for in rural industrialisation becomes impossible. Then again there is the further question of protection that may be necessary for rural industries in view of the lack of the internal economy from which rural industries would suffer whatever may be the answer to the first two questions. Prof. Malkani has already referred to this question and various suggestions have been put forward. But all these suggestions require some detailed consideration as there are a large number of difficulties in implementing any one of these suggestions. Demarcation of markets and the imposition of taxes in order to see that goods from the urban centres do not reach the rural centres in unfairly competitive conditions are some of the suggestions that have been made. One great advantage of a vast country is the large number of markets that are available for the goods that are produced in the country. However if these markets are artificially restricted and goods are not allowed to move from one centre to another I am afraid more problems would be raised than solved if this protection is sought to be given in this manner. Yet protection has to be given to the rural industries if these rural industries are to develop. Therefore serious and competent thinking is necessary in this connection and again time is running fast. Therefore it is desirable that we should have some authority which could examine the various issues involved and determine the policy with regard to this matter also.",
18: "Mr. Vice Chairman I wish the matter had not come up for discussion in this House in the form in which it has come because we will be discussing it appears the same subject more or less piecemeal in connection with the other two Bills as well. What was necessary for the Government in this connection was to provide for a general discussion on the report of the Finance Commission the kind of thing that we have on such reports and after hearing the views of the Members here they should have formulated a Bill. Even if they had formulated the Bill earlier the Bill should have been preceded by a discussion on the report. It would then have given us an opportunity of dealing with this rather important subject in our public finance and indeed in our national life. But now we are asked to treat this matter piecemeal and deal with the Bill as it comes separately. I say Sir this would not seem very fair. It is true that we have had two other Reports of the Finance Commission and that we have had certain opportunities of discussing the issues raised by the Finance Commission on previous occasions. But that should not have precluded a thorough discussion of the Third Report more especially after the experience of the two five year plans and generally also after the experience of the States in the matter of public finance and as regards relations between the States and the Centre. All I can say is that the Government does not understand the magnitude of the problem or the urgency or the seriousness of the issues involved. It is possibly because they think that all the State Governments are under their control and that the State Governments would toe the line whatever is laid down from here. Suppose Sir today a number of States had been outside the control of the same party which controls the Central Government problems would have become acute because conflicts between the State Governments controlled by certain other parties and those controlled by the Congress Party which controls the Central Government would have arisen sharply calling for a thorough discussion and mutual consultation in a different way. Once they can get passed whatever they like and also once it is passed the States will more or less accept without any protest the dispensation of the Centre. Now that the Bill is before us we have to speak on this subject rather on the general themes. Yet I would like to make certain general observations in this connection because the basis of the Bill is the Report of the Third Finance Commission. This is a long standing issue facing the public finance of the country. Those who have studied Economics will know well how this matter had come up even during the British time when we did not have either independence or any kind of autonomy in the States even in that set-up. Even at that time the State Governments functioning under the British felt that something should be done with regard to the relations between the Centre and the States. There had been a long-standing controversy as to how the taxes especially the income-tax should be divided between the Centre and the States. I do not deny the existence of the controversy and this controversy is not easy to resolve. I entirely agree. But I should have thought that the Third Finance Commission should be tried to face the problems before it not more or less in a routine manner but in the context of the new things not only as they are today but as they are going to shape in the coming future. We have got what is called a quasi-federal Constitution. I do not say federal Constitution although the spirit is there but a Quasi-Federal Constitution because most of the powers many of the powers that should remain with the States are now in the hands of the Central Government. Therefore in that way it is more Unitary in character than federal. At the same time structurally speaking we have got the State Assemblies Legislatures State Budgets and so on. They function more or less in the same way. But if you go a little deeper into the affairs it would immediately lead you to think that the States do not have any substantial real power especially in the matter of finance. Perhaps at the time when the Constitution was framed this aspect did not figure very much in the minds of the makers of the Constitution. We had just become free and the concept of welding India into a solid nation was uppermost in the minds of those people who framed the Constitution and all others as well. In that background it was quite understandable that it should be the dominant thought as to how to put the put the different segments of our country into a whole namely the Indian Union.",
19: "Sir I would like to make a few observations so that the hon’ble Minister will make a note about the way in which these institutions are being run. It is a good thing that these institutions have been started. But at the same time we are suffering from lack of co-ordination in regard to our technical education. We have certain institutes like the polytechnic etc under the Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs Ministry and they are run through the State Governments. Then there are the engineering colleges under the universities and thirdly Sir trade technical education is imparted by the Central Labour Ministry at the State level. In addition to that the States have certain arrangements of their own for technical education. I feel that there is no effort at co-ordination and that leads to a good deal of confusion. Perhaps if there is effort there are certain difficulties. I hope the hon’ble Minister will tell us about that. I would also like to suggest that even in these four institutions as for some time the medium of instruction would be English for emotional integration an attempt should be made to take a few students from the neighbouring region or other regions on a reciprocal basis. Otherwise these institutes will themselves be developing as was hinted by the previous speaker some regional consciousness. There is great difficulty Sir with regard to technical personnel for teaching and I am not aware in what way these institutes will be staffed. Perhaps some foreigners will be brought in but at the same time with the arrangements existing at present for taking technical help from different countries – Russia U.K. U.S.A. and Germany I do not know whether there will be special courses provided in these Institutes. For the teaching staff from those different countries what arrangements there are one does not know. In the present arrangement for teaching I should have liked to mention the fifth arrangement for teaching at present provided through the various industrial concerns like Bhilai Rourkela etc. All these big concerns have their big technical schools and they take their students for post-graduate work as also for research work. What will therefore happen with regard to the standard is a question. Sir we are not at all sure in our country about the correct use of terms. I would for instance mention here the word ‘polytechnic’. They have one school and even if there is arrangement for starting another subject no effort is made and no sooner they feel they should give out proper enquiries with regard to the possibilities for employment and the various mineral resources etc. and the basic education that should enable the students to enter the polytechnics to have the training where it is available these polytechnics are started. Similarly there is some confusion about the use of the word ‘university’. We have the Roorkee University for one subject i.e. engineering. So it seems there is going to be one university for one faculty. We have one music university also in Madhya Pradesh. We are going to start I am told perhaps a university only for agriculture. So if these institutes are there which term seems to be really the appropriate word in place of these one-faculty universities I think the hon’ble Minister should take the initiative in determining what should be the exact connotation of these terms. Otherwise one day as was pointed out there will be perfect confusion. There comes also the question of the recognition of the degree given by these Institutes. Of course if the training with the special facilities available and the specially recruited staff available is of a high standard naturally people who have passed out from there. In the beginning there will not be any trouble with regard to making use of the graduates turned out from there. But the question of recognition has to be decided on certain principles and those principles should be laid down and followed from the beginning. Now I would like also to mention the question about scholarships. It was pointed out that certain scholarships especially to the children of the working class should be given. I would like to point out here that there is already provision for that and it is not something new. What I would like to stress is that scholarships should be in larger numbers. The scholarships do not seem to be adequate for the rising standard of living and the cost of living. The scholarships that are given do not meet half the need. There is yet another matter which the hon’ble Minister is the proper person to enquire about and that is the merit scholarships that are available in different States to students for technical subjects or to other students who pass with very high marks are not given by the States if they read outside the State.",
20: "Mr. Deputy Chairman Sir I extend to this resolution my whole-hearted support though I wish he had extended its scope by incorporating within it two more services but then I cannot deal with that subject now. You have assured me that the matter will be taken up on a subsequent occasion. I do not know when that subsequent occasion is likely to occur. Sir I am grateful to the Home Minister for some kind words he has said about me in regard to my interest in this subject. No doubt for long I have been urging the necessity of creating more all-India Services. During the last five years or so ever since that recommendation on the subject was made by the States Reorganisation Commission and during the last one year and a half near about that time I have been tabling Resolutions on the subject twice or thrice but they could not come up. Of course as they say there are higher forces that govern the destiny of things and so far as Parliament is concerned it is the Government and the undisputed sway of the Chair that govern the density of Resolutions. Obviously it was so ordained that this Resolution should come up only now and that too as a Government-sponsored Resolution. Even as it is I welcome it most heartily and feel enthusiastic and even jubilant about it. Sir I sincerely congratulate the hon’ble the Home Minister for the tact the firmness the strength and the determination which he has shown in overcoming all the delicacies and difficulties which I am sure were there in his way. The opposition and unwillingness of the States were there initially I know. And I also know Sir that about a year ago when I tabled a question on this subject the then Home Minister told us that the Government would be only too glad to have more all-India Services but then the handicap in their way was that the States were not agreeable to it. Subsequent to that Sir about the middle of this year I wrote to all the Chief Ministers requesting them to let me know their views on this subject and I was a little unhappy to find that no Chief Minister replied to me saying that he was agreeable to it. One or two of them especially said that they were against it. So all these difficulties were there in the way of the Home Minister. But I find that by his sweet persuasion he has been able to win over all the Chief Ministers who in the conference immediately preceding the last one agreed to it in principle and in the subsequent conference they agreed to it it appears obviously in toto and hence we have before us this Resolution supported by the Chief Ministers of all the States. Sir for that I want to congratulate most sincerely and heartily the hon’ble the Home Minister. Now Sir so far as the merits of this Resolution are concerned. I do not think it is necessary for me to elaborate on them because during the last four years or so ever since the publication of the Report of the States Reorganisation Commission many eminent men all over the country eminent administrators and persons who had experience of administration including the retired comptroller and Auditor General were of the opinion that more all-India Services should be created. Our Hon’ble the Prime Minister as also our Vice-President have on more than one occasion expressed themselves definitely in favour of having more all-India Services. Last year Sir about the month of October when addressing the Indian Police officers when they were going out after having had their training for a year he expressly said that if national integration was to be maintained it was necessary to have more all-India Services. That being so I think there is not much need for us to emphasise the necessity and the utility for having more all-India Services. Sir in the interest of efficiency and also in the interest of integrity it is absolutely necessary that we should have these three all-India Services as also some other. The major problem these days before us is that successful implementation of the development programmes has to be carried through. It is not enough that we should have big schemes. It is not enough that we should allocate large sums for the implementation of those schemes. But it is necessary that we should have competent personnel to effectively implement our schemes so that in a short time we may be able to carry forward our country to economic prosperity all around. In the past during the pre-Independence period we had quite a number of all-India Services but then when we framed our Constitution we dispensed with the others retaining only two. It appears to me that necessity has now arisen for reorganisation of the all-India Services and to have more all-India Services.",
21: "Now coming back to the question of minorities you will please find why this particular Resolution has been so widely put in that it might include a religious minority as well a linguistic minority as well or an economic minority as some hon’ble Members rightly pointed out. Now Sir a question arises whether there ought to be any such protection in so far as a particular type of minority is concerned. I shall deal with the question of minorities at some length. But you will please find Sir what the hon’ble mover wants is that there ought to be endowed with statutory powers. Therefore Sir an attempt is being made for the first time by my hon’ble friend for driving a wedge between a community and a community. So far as the Constitution is concerned as my hon’ble friend rightly pointed out whenever the question of minorities arises we have to be extremely careful. The Constitution is a very sacred document which has embodied all the different aspects of the common question of India’s nationality. India is one in spite of different types of languages and religions. But in the midst of all these diversities we have to develop a common nationality. Therefore whenever we consider the question of the development of the nation and the interest of the nation you cannot afford to think in terms either of religion or of language. It is true Sir that there are different religions. It is also true that there are different languages. Therefore a question arose and the framers of the Constitution had to devise a Constitution in the midst of the unity of India with certain diversities here and there. For that purpose what they did was they devised a common nationality for the whole of India and in so far as religious minorities were concerned they were given certain rights. I would not go into the details regarding the provisions of the Fundamental Rights regarding the practice of religion. Certain rights have been given to the religious minorities and beyond that it would not be proper to bring in the religious minorities for political rights. For that we have to be extremely careful. I would also point out that while we have to develop a common nationality the members of the Indian nation have to understand that we are one nation. Therefore certain rights in respect of religious minorities were given. They were Fundamental Rights and most of them are justiciable rights. Here we stopped so far as the religious rights were concerned. Then a question arose what ought to be the attitude of not only the Government but the society regarding the languages. It was true that there were certain interests of the regional languages. Now these languages required to be developed but they were not meant for dividing one man from the other. So in 1956 when the States were formed to a certain extent on the basis of language what was done was not to have a State with cent per cent people belonging to the regional language because there were bound to be people belonging to different languages. That was the reason why this question was considered at great length and the States Reorganisation Commission also went into this question of linguistic minorities. It was bound to arise here and there because they were likely to feel that their rights and safeguards given to them might or might not be properly implemented. So this question was considered first by the States Reorganisation Commission and they dealt with the question whether we should have a permanent Minorities Commission. They went into it very carefully and shrewdly. They found out that it would not be proper to set up a permanent Minorities commission because the result if not the actual effect would be that a permanent wedge would be driven between one community and another community. So far as language minorities were concerned they had a right so far as their own languages were concerned. They had also an obligation to understand the language of the majority in the particular State. It is only by thus coming together that the members of the two language groups would come together and would harmoniously develop but it was found at the time when the States Reorganisation Commission had to consider this that some machinery should be devised for safeguarding the rights of linguistic minorities only and after full consideration what was conceded was that only in respect of linguistic minorities certain rights should be extended and certain rights should be safeguarded and an officer should be appointed by the President for making a report on the question whether these rights of the linguistic minorities are or are not properly safeguarded.",
22: "Coming to the internal affairs of the country Madam Deputy Chairman the policies of the Government of India for the last fifteen years have been so manipulated that the rich people are becoming richer and the poorer sections of the people are becoming still poorer. The committee that has been appointed to investigate into the question of the distribution of income has not yet given its verdict but it is common knowledge that the people who are in the higher-ups have become more rich and the people in the lower rung have become poorer. The prices of essential commodities that the peasants and the workers use have gone up so high that they are not within the reach of the mass of the people of the country. Government have not taken adequate steps to bring down the prices and to stabilise the prices as was recommended by the Foodgrains Committee. We are now in the Third Plan. While the plans are progressing the number of the unemployed in the country is increasing. This is a very anomalous position. It is the Government alone that can explain why in spite of the Plans the unemployment problem is becoming more and more acute. As was rightly pointed out yesterday by some speakers our agriculture has not been paid due attention that should have been paid to in a country where 80 per cent of the people live on land. Some three of four years back when Mr. Ajit Prasad Jain was the Food and Agriculture Minister he was made to resign under shady circumstances as one who had proved not capable of solving the food problem in the country a suggestion was thrown that the portfolio of Agriculture should be handled by an important and senior Member of the Cabinet and particularly in the States by the Chief Ministers of the States. But nothing of the sort has happened. Whatever increase in foodgrains output we have obtained is not because of any increase in the yield per acre but because of extensive cultivation more land has been brought under cultivation and some irrigation facilities have now been provided. But the increase that we have seen is not in keeping with the demand that is necessary for us to feed 400 millions in India. So whatever industrial development we want the basic factor is that our agricultural economy should be improved. For that all efforts should be made more fertilisers should be used and new methods of cultivation should be employed for growing more food crops and for growing other cash crops. In a review that was published by the Planning Commission itself they have pointed out that there is acute shortage of power in more than 50 per cent of the States in India. We have accepted a planned economy we have completed two Plans and we are now in the Third Plan. I do not know why the Planning Commission or the planners concerned did not foresee this shortage of power in most of the States in India and why they did not plan generation of more power so that people will not accuse the State Governments or the Planning Commission that they did not work out the plans properly in order to have more industries and to have more foodgrains produced through lift irrigation. In most of the States- in Andhra in West Bengal in Bihar in Karnataka – power shortage whatever power is available now is being rationed. There are thousands of units of small scale industries which are not working for want of power and there are thousands of lift irrigation pumps which are denied power supply for purposes of irrigating their lands and wherever power is supplied it is during nights which is not very convenient to make use of the power and use the power for agricultural purposes. The Finance Minister in the statement that he made in the Lok Sabha and which was placed before us has stated that it was assessed that for the successful implementation of the Plan even after taking every possible measure for the development of our exports which clearly must be given the highest priority we would need external assistance of the order of Rs. 2600 crores and we have however been less successful in obtaining and utilising the external assistance required for financing the imports necessary for our developing economy. To industrialise our country and to bring it on par with other well developed countries we do need assistance – financial technical and other assistance. The Finance Minister was so hopeful that he was getting Rs. 2600 crores of foreign aid from Aid India Club and other countries. But now he is not hopeful of getting that amount which is necessary to fulfil the targets in the Third Five Year Plan.",
23: "Madam Deputy Chairman when the house rose for lunch I was discussing the response of the public to the loan programme of the Government and was trying to point out that it was rather a serious tendency in the sense that the response of the public had been proved to be poorer during the Tenth Plan period than during the Ninth Plan period. I was trying to point out that looking to the fact that the national income was rising and the people were becoming more conscious of a developing economy and the need to mobilise the resources more and more a contrary trend ought to have appeared and that in view of that this trend was disturbing. This trend is to be contrasted with the trend of the public regarding the call from the corporate sector for the investment of their moneys. Here we find that the shares of some of the new companies or of the old companies that are issuing new shares are over-subscribed at times to the extent of fifteen times the capital that has been asked for by the companies. So here are two pictures; one the picture of the Government asking the public to subscribe to the public loans and the other the picture of the response of the public to the corporate sector demanding investments form the public. While on the one hand there is an enthusiastic response to the demand from the corporate sector on the other there is a very poor response as far as the loan programme of the Government is concerned. This is a matter of some concern and I feel that the Government should pay more attention than just exhorting the people to save more and to hand over their savings to the Government as the hon’ble Finance Minister has done more than once. If it would have been merely a question of rediverting the money that is coming from the corporate sector to the public exchequer in the form of loans perhaps the matter would not have been so serious. Then it would have been just a question of re-allocation of the functions between the public sector and the private sector. But I feel that there is a large amount of money which is just changing to some lucrative channel and that explains why the response to the demand from the corporate sector is fifteen times. This shows that fourteen times that particular capital is not required by that company and if there had been some adequate step or measure whereby originally that money could have gone to the public exchequer to that extent there would not have been any disappointment to the people who wanted shares but who did not get them and disappointment to the public exchequer by not getting the response which it ought to have got. That to my mind leads to the question of the pattern of the rate of interest. In a developing economy and especially in view of the fact that a large number of companies are being floated today which have got an element of growth in them thereby attracting so much capital towards them the Government of India will to take into consideration the question of the rate pattern of interest on their loans and to see whether something could not be done whereby the public will be attracted to a large extent towards their loan programme that Hitherto. It has appeared in the press that the question of supply and want is being reconsidered and that offers are sought to be made more attractive. If in the same strain the entire question of the loan programme is also considered it may be possible that these loans also might be made more attractive and thereby more capital which is today just changing the channels of profitable employment might be diverted to the public exchequer in the form of public loan. Then there is the question of the State Governments performing their part which has been assigned to them during the Eleventh Plan period. In this connection I would like to draw the attention of the hon’ble House to a very important recommendation which has been made by the Eleventh Finance Commission namely the appointment of a high-power commission to go into the entire question of the allocation of financial resources between the Central Government and the State Governments. They have argued the whole case in nearly one and a half pages in order to show why it has now become necessary that a high-power commission should be appointed to go into this important question. According to the Third Finance Commission the allocation of resources between the centre and the states was made at a time when planned economic development was not visualised. When the constitution was framed the development of the public sector the new responsibilities which the states were going to assume and a Plan era were not properly visualised and it was under these conditions that these allocations were being made.",
24: "Madam Deputy Chairman I rise to support the Bill which has been moved by the hon’ble Minister of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs. This Bill incorporates certain sentiments which the country holds so dear as far as the office of President is concerned and also incorporates the faith of the people in themselves that when they will elect a President the person who would be occupying the high post would be a person who would have not only the love and affection of the people but would be as the hon’ble Minister pointed out a dedicated politician whose whole life is dedicated to the service of the nation before he became the President during his occupation of the President and even after he retired from that office. It is this confidence of the people in themselves and the high love and affection which they hold for this office which have resulted in this particular bill being considered by the House at the present moment. The hon’ble Minister has pointed out that the President who has just retired has fulfilled all the requirements which are the basis of this particular measure and the measure which was passed in 2001. I wish that he had mentioned the last Governor General also to whom both the measures apply. Whether we may agree or may not agree with the last Governor-General on some of the political views that the holds there can be no two opinions that the last Governor- General was also an illustrious son and is an illustrious son of this country and deserves all the consideration all the love and all respect of the country which are being incorporated in the present measure and were incorporated in the 2001 Act. While therefore fully supporting the measure which is now before the House I would like certain clarifications regarding the rules that are going to be made for giving effect to the provisions which have been incorporated in the present Bil. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons we are told that a person holding the high office of President has even after retirement many public calls on him and it is therefore considered desirable to provide him with secretarial staff. It is further stated that the bill provides for a staff which may be engaged for the President. Staff might be appointed for him and office space might be provided for him. It is because of this that certain misgivings have arisen in the minds of some of the members and they want it to be made perfectly clear that the staff will be appointed by the ex-President and it will be his wishes and his desires that will be taken into account when a particular person is being appointed. Also regarding the office which is engaged for him his wishes should be taken into account so that he knows what would be a convenient place for him and he may try to get that place. Another reason for insisting on what I consider to be an important detail is that if the Government appoints the staff for the ex-President then automatically they become Government servants because they have been appointed by the Government. It may be that in the rules a clarification might be attempted whereby they may be exempted from some of the Service Conduct Rules which are applicable to normal Government Servants. But even there it will be much better that this should not be left in any doubt and that these persons that are appointed to assist the ex-President in this secretarial task are appointed by the ex-President himself. They would be the staff of the ex-President and would not be appointed by the Government for the ex-President and would not be Government servants. This point ought to be made quite clear so that the ex-President has got all the right of determining the service conditions of the people appointed by him of course subject to the overall limit which has been provided and to my mind rightly provided in the bill. Within that overall limit perhaps it will be much better to leave the rest of the matter to the president himself so that we may also express our further confidence in the President to the effect that he would utilise it with discretion and with all sense of responsibility and fairplay and taking into account the interests of the public and of the public exchequer too. Another point which also needs some clarification is regarding the payment to be made for the secretarial assistance and for the secretarial staff. Normally Government rules required that whenever any such demand is made on the public exchequer or on the Consolidated Fund of India a certain formality has to be gone through and that formality of accounting has to be in a prescribed form.",
25: "Mr. Vice-Chairman first of all I must place of record my grateful thanks to the University Grants Commission for the work that they have done for the advancement of higher education. They have done good work and in full co-operation with the Education Ministry. This I think must encourage State Governments to establish university grants commissions or committees in their respective states. What the country needs most is the coordinated efforts of the autonomous university grants commissions working in harmony with the State Governments and university authorities. Coordinated efforts are needed to bring about certain uniformity in the standards of university education. Without that our educational advancement is bound to suffer from various tensions and difficulties. I do agree with my friend that the Annual Report under discussion is rather a dull report. At least it is not as bright as the two previous Reports were. In the previous two reports the University Grants Commission invited the attention of the nation to certain educational needs. Unfortunately in this Report the University Grants Commission confines its remarks mostly to what has been achieved in the field of university education under the guidance and with the assistance of the University Grants Commission. However Sir It is not possible for me to agree with Mr. Santhanam that the University Grants Commission should not extend help to universities for the preservation of manuscripts. Manuscripts are of great importance so far as university libraries are concerned. It is the duty of universities to preserve those manuscripts and it is the duty of the University Grants Commission to extend to universities the necessary financial assistance for maintaining and preserving manuscripts in good order. Also it is not possible for me Sir to agree with my friend that today universities are enjoying too much of autonomy. I agree with the University Grants Commission which two years ago remarked that freedom is vital for education and democracy and I personally feel Sir that on one plea or the other university autonomy and academic freedom are being restricted rather than being extended as they must be. I do not think Sir that a social purpose or a social value can be imparted in the teaching by a teacher through the imposition of restrictions on his freedom of thinking. I feel that teachers need academic freedom for discharging their duties in an efficient way. If we take into consideration the affiliated colleges we will notice that the teachers are subjected to such humiliating conditions that it is not possible for them to discharge their duties to their students to impart to their students any sense of responsibility or any moral values in their lives. I therefore Sir feel that it is necessary to be more careful about the preservation of academic freedom to teachers. Sir we are grateful to the Education Ministry and to the University Grants Commission for upgrading the salaries of teachers in the Central universities. Yet a great disparity prevails in the salaries of teachers of Central Universities and State Universities and affiliated colleges and this disparity is causing a lot of heart-burning and a lot of difficulties. As one connected with education I may say that there is not such a marked difference in the quality of teachers serving in the Central Universities and in the State Universities and in affiliated colleges as to justify the great disparity in the salaries of teachers of these institutions. I feel Sir that we must keep in our mind the remarks of the University Grants Commission made in their earlier Annual Report with regard to teachers salaries. We are not only to provide adequate salaries to teachers of affiliated colleges but also to teachers of secondary schools. We must remember Sir that a great majority of students study in affiliated colleges and the quality of education is largely determined by the quality of work that is done in affiliated colleges. For important in the quality of teaching improvement in living conditions is also very necessary. The University Grants Commission has invited or attention in its Report to the appalling conditions in which teachers have to live. But unfortunately the University Grants Commission has to admit that it does not seem likely that we shall be make anything more than the marginal contribution towards this practical need. I feel that the University Grants Commission should pay more attention to the solution of this problem than has so far been paid by it and the Education Ministry and that the Government should not grudge funds to the University Grants Commission for making adequate arrangements for improving living conditions of teachers who are expected to train the citizens of the country. Sir in the University Grants Commission Report it is maintained that Rs. 12000 should be granted to every affiliated college for the welfare of the teaching staff and that efforts should be made to provide them with quarters and that too in the vicinity of the college where they teach.",
26: "Mr. Vice-Chairman I would now like to make a few observations on the Ministry of Education. Education is basic to any national Regeneration. It is true that it does not bring any return as our other projects do as for instance the steel projects or the irrigation projects do. But this is the investment that is designed to help building up of the human material. It is agreed that education has expanded after independence and during the plan periods. But it is a matter for concern that the content of education has not been equal to our expectations. Even today we are engaged in experimenting with all types of education from the basic stage up to the university level. It is not clear. I presume that the basic pattern of education of which so much was said and written is accepted as a success even today. Where do we stand with regard to the basic pattern? It seems to be the position that all arguments are in favour of that type of education but all proof is against the success of such a type of education. Where does the Government stand with regard to this type of education? We swore by the basic type of education because it was discovered by the Father of the Nation. But if it has been a failure why should not the Government say that that is the position? Then again take secondary education and also collegiate education. Three years ago it was said that all universities should have three year degree courses and some universities which were reluctant to accept this reform were more or less compelled to do so and they accepted it. Now certain universities find that this scheme is not working satisfactorily and they feel that they should have a two-year course in the college before students could enter the degree course. I mention this to show that this eternal tinkering with education should stop and it should not go on like this. This uncertainty is not only with regard to the main objective of education the main structure of education from the primary to the collegiate level but also with regard to the courses of studies and also with regard to the language or medium of instruction. Mr. Chairman up to the secondary stage it has been accepted that the medium of instruction should be the regional language. The National Integration Council however stated that if universities are to exchange professors if they have to develop freely then there should be the common medium of instruction namely English and Hindi. Now at the latest National Integration Council meeting we are told that the medium of instruction in the colleges should also be the regional language ultimately and if that comes to pass I ask how will national integration be achieved? It is permissible to envisage a stage if the scheme of the National Integration Council is implemented where different universities will have different media of instruction and the men that will be drawn from these universities will have to man the judiciary of the land and the all-India services. But they will not be able to serve in a State other than the one in which they were educated. How can integration be achieved? We are working at cross purposes. It is time that a high power body was appointed to hammer out a national scheme of education having integration as the basic aim and to implement it systematically. The present method of meddling at every stage of education the present climate in which we are not clear about the medium of instruction at different stages is causing concern to the parents to the pupils and weakening the country in the process. This is a major problem at this stage of the development of the country. Then Mr. Vice-Chairman I would pass on to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. According to this Ministry we are to build a system of National Highways provincial or State Highways an integrated system of communication form the village upwards but the Central Government is concerned with the construction of National Highways. It is good to have a fine system of National Highways. It also serves as a physical link for integrating the nation. It is good but this planning of construction of National Highways without regard to the development of railways and the development of industries in the regions in which the Highways are proposed to be constructed will be something beyond our means at the present moment. Assuming that we have a network of National Highways are they to be put to immediate use? Are they good investments? Unless you have industries small big or medium coming along the highways unless they assure you a fair return for the investment it is not desirable to have a system of Highways for the sake of mere transport of passengers. In other words we should have a scheme of priorities for the National Highways so that they can be looked after.",
27: "Mr. Vice Chairman Sir I rise to support the Plantations Labour (Amendment) Bill brought up by the Government for our consideration. Sir the sad plight of millions of toiling people who sweat on various plantations in the country to earn valuable foreign exchange for us in really too much to be expressed in words. These workers live and work in most inhuman and pitiable conditions. These plantations include tea coffee cinchona rubber etc. and as we know tea alone is one of the major foreign exchange earners of our country. But Sir it is indeed most regrettable that notwithstanding a lapse of 62 years since our Independence these workers who earn crores and crores of rupees by way of foreign exchange have to live in most miserable conditions. They live in houses that are most insecure and collapse frequently and when these workers die as a result of these collapses their guardians or their dependents do not get even due compensation for the loss that they have to bear. Unhygienic living in distant and far-flung areas compounded with lack of medical and educational facilities make their life utterly miserable. These Plantation workers have to live in abject poverty like slaves of their employers. And as we know most of these plantations are still foreign-owned establishments last vestiges of the colonial rule the British rule and as I said it is a matter of deep regret for all of us that despite enacting an Act the Plantations Labour Act 2001 we have not yet been able to effect any improvement in their condition. I think the employers alone are not responsible for their miserable condition. We are also as much responsible as they are because although we could enforce the enactment and we could improve their conditions much earlier we have failed in doing so. Sir on the 9th May 2003 this House the Rajya Sabha decided that a Joint Committee should be appointed to look into the desired amendment and put up a draft as early as possible for our consideration. On the 26th May 2003 the Lok Sabha also adopted our Resolution our motion with the result that a 45-Member committee in which 15 representatives were from the Rajya Sabha and 30 from the Lok Sabha was appointed to look into the matte. This Committee was to submit its report on the 1st day of the 15th Session of the Rajya Sabha that was in 2003. But this Committee had to be granted these extension and the report was ultimately available on the 3rd March 2005. At that time as we all know the so-called JP’s movement of total revolution was at its peak. Within two or three months the national emergency had to be declared and during the emergency priorities had changed and we could not just effect this desired improvement at that time and we could not bring about this legislation. And then the Janta rule and the Lok Dal rule. For 30 months they were in power but they too-although they try to pose to be the champions of the downtrodden and the workers-filed to deliver the goods and that is why today we are going to consider the report of that committee that was presented to the Government in 2005. Therefore we are also equally responsible for not ameliorating their conditions and their plight. The Committee had to consider 120 memoranda giving views and suggestions from various unions and associations and 59 witnesses appeared before the committee and that committee itself came to the conclusion that in various areas even the barest minimum facilities such as arrangement for supply of wholesome drinking water latrines urinals provision of qualified doctors had not been provided though these amenities are a must under the act. The Act has been there but we could not enforce it; we could not implement it only because the employers did not want it; they did not want to give to the workers due justice. Inadequacy of punishments that are awarded under the Act is one of the main impediments standing in the way of implementation of various welfare measures. Courts generally take a lenient view of the offences under the Act and they let off the employers who are offenders with light punishment which generally amounts to a fine of Rs.100. So the Committee suggested amendment to section 36 of the Act. An employer is required to provide these workers living accommodation but generally in spite of the fact that the Government gives loans and subsidies to the employers for construction of houses progress in regard to these constructions is very poor. As I said earlier very unhygienic and insecure houses are there where these people have to live. Even compensation to the workers in the event of house collapse is not given.",
28: "Mr. Vice-Chairman I was speaking about the need for developing a strong U.N. delegation. I wish that the hon’ble Prime Minister would give his attention to this aspect of the matter particularly in view of the fact that in the next decade or two politics all over the world would take on a complex character and it is necessary that men are trained from now on for taking part in international affairs. In the U.K. and the United States such delegations are built with men who have wide knowledge of international affairs and there should be other qualification for a man to be included in such a delegation. In this connection I should like to mention that it is time for Government to develop sound conventions regarding the conduct of foreign affairs. In the United States they have accepted the principle of bipartisan consultation on important affairs of policy. For example when President Kennedy stood for election President Eisenhower even during the period of the conduct of the campaign of President Kennedy kept him informed about major developments in foreign affairs. We have seen our Government sending troops out of this country to the Congo and at that time I had raised the point that before troops left our country for any assignments of an unusual character like the Congo assignment Members of the Opposition should be informally consulted. There will be no question of any leakage of information whatever if leaders in the Opposition are consulted on important aspects of foreign policy. The Consultative Committee of the External Affairs Ministry does go some way to meet the needs of exchanging information about foreign affairs but the informal consultation of the kind that I mention where the Leader of the Opposition and leaders of other Parties are called and told by the Prime Minister about unusual developments would strengthen the convention that the foreign policy of the country has the support not only of the Congress Party but also of the entire country. I was speaking about our external publicity and it is a subject on which I think I can speak with some confidence as I have been an old time newspaperman in this country. The material which is sent out to foreign countries is extremely scrappy and useless. There is included in these messages some statement of what this Minister was saying somewhere. We are trying to give publicity to ministerial activities and it is inevitable that some such publicity should be given because Ministers are in charge of the Government but one abroad does not get a real idea of what is happening in the country. I would like to suggest for the consideration of the External Affairs Ministry that they should send a fortnightly assessment of what is happening in India written dispassionately not to please a Minister or to highlight something that he has done but to give an objective assessment of what is going on in the country. In the old days when the British Government was in existence such fortnightly reports used to be sent by various State Governments and I think a beginning can be made in that direction in this matter. The other point I would like to suggest is that publicity is a complicated and technical matter. The Foreign Service as it is constituted today does not have sufficient training in publicity. The Estimates Committee which went into the demands of the External Affairs Ministry mentioned about the methods of training which have been adopted but since our Foreign Service men are not trained in publicity work and one sees for example that a lot of confusion has arisen in the United States over Ambassador Nehru’s statement I think the External Affairs Ministry might well set up a Committee of Members of Parliament who are conversant with external publicity and some newspapermen to advise the External Affairs Ministry from time to time. I do not think that the Committee will ask for information which is confidential or secret but they can assist the newspapermen. There are a handful of competent men who would be willing to serve on the Committee in an advisory capacity. They would be able to tell the External Affairs Ministry what should be done in order that our news publicity abroad is better. I might mention also that the Estimates Committee had recommended the creation of a cultural cell. Sir to my mind we have also to be clear in our mind regarding the objective of rural industrialization. Do we mean to have only diversification of rural economy and are we going to have rural industrialisation only in order to give some help to those who find themselves unemployed during a certain period of the year? Are we aiming at utilising local resources and meeting local needs through diversification of rural economy or have we a more fundamental objective in mind when we are trying to industrialise the rural areas? Without this I am afraid rural industrialization will not be possible.",
29: "If you scan the history of the railways in this country you will see that it was the Presidency towns- Bombay Madras and Calcutta- that determined the pattern of our railways as well as of our industrial and economic growth. The British when they landed in this country established trading centres called forts. In Chennai it was Fort St. George; in Kolkata it was Fort St. Williams and in Mumbai it was merely a Fort and there was one in Surat also. It is these trading establishments which determined the pattern of government the pattern of administration and every other pattern under the British regime. They constructed the railways they established the industries they located their armies with reference to these three Presidency towns. This idea of the Presidency towns determining the pattern of our social structure industrial advancement and the system of our railways still persists. That is the mental lag that is hampering the vision of the Planning Commission the Railway Board and the Railways Ministry. Sir once I happened to travel from London to Rome by train. Another time I had to travel from Moscow to Leningrad by train. Nowhere did I find on the continent of Europe lines of varying breadth. It is all a uniform gauge. So is it in Russia- it may be 6 ft. there. In America in every industrially advanced country you find that the gauge is uniform. This very country which ruled us namely the United Kingdom had inside its border a uniform gauge but they inflicted three systems of gauge on India. They thought that that would perpetuate what is called their domination or in the negative sense that it would impede the industrial and economic growth of India. Secondly it would make India always the customer and purchaser of lines and locomotives and rolling stock from the United Kingdom. In the old days I am told it is the Government which built the broad-guage line and it is the private companies that took to this metre gauge and narrow gauge. Though they may not have had the distinction of private and public sector in view then it now appears that what the so-called public sector then did has been good and what the private sector then did has been to our disadvantage. I would appeal to these agencies to introduce a uniform guage throughout India. In this connection it will be interesting to note the talk of the hon’ble Railway Minister about the schools primary schools higher secondary schools and high schools for the Indian Railways. If you examine the previous speech of the Railway Minister and also the working report of the Railway Board you will find that the same figure is repeated every year. I have examined the figures and I find that this year only 16 schools have been added out of which 13 are primary schools one is a higher secondary school and two are middle or high schools. Instead of saying that they have been able only to provide 13 primary schools or one or two more high schools or higher secondary schools the same figures are repeated in the speech. Although the railway Board has all along been saying that education is the responsibility of the State and therefore the Railway Board does not own this responsibility I would like to remind the Railway Minister about the agreement reached between the National Federation of Railwaymen and the Railway Board in the year 2005 according to which the Railway Board undertook to provide primary schools for the education of the children of railway employees. Sir as I told you earlier I had to say many things on the floor of this House but I will conclude with only one or two more observations. I will first deal with the labour relations on the Indian Railways. I slightly differ from my hon’ble Friend when he quoted me as saying that the permanent negotiating machinery has completely failed. It is a fact that this machinery is not functioning satisfactorily. At certain place it has failed. There is no doubt about it. But I would say in this House most frankly that at the Board’s level this machinery has been working successfully. But this is not the position so far as the zonal railways are concerned. I do not say that in all the zonal railways it is so but in certain zonal railways and in most of the divisions of these railways it has failed. I was expecting that the Railway Minister would examine the working of this machinery in all the railways. What is the greatest defect in this machinery? This machinery suffers to the extent that at the board level if there is difference of opinion between the Railway Board and the railway labour no arbitration machinery is provided to settle the disputes. The provision in this machinery is that as and when an occasion arises an Ad Hoc Tribunal would be set up by Government.",
30: "May I Madam draw the attention of the hon’ble Minister to an important Committee set up by the Government of India in 1998 under the chairmanship of Mr. Negi who was asked to enquire into the various problems of railway-road co-ordination? Their preliminary report appeared sometime ago and it was even circulated to all the State Governments for their opinion. But to my regret I have to say that the work of this Committee has been very much hindered as a result of the indifference and may I say callous negligence on the part of the State Governments as well as on the part of the Ministry concerned in taking up this question and in pursuing it so that we may be able to have a clear and comprehensive picture of the transport situation in the country. Now railway transport like any other mode of transport is suffering under a major handicap the handicap being that we do not know nor does the Railway Ministry know what the exact quantum of transport requirement in the country is and what the rising demand is which the Railways are expected to cater to in future. Certain targets which have been worked out in the Tenth Plan have been given to us. In the Ninth Plan we were given certain targets. But unfortunately Madam may I point out that all those targets were either gross under-estimates or exaggerations? Throughout we have seen that we have not been able to have a well-coordinated and progressive development of the transport system and in particular the railway system in the country. So anything we suggest today will have that kind of air of unreality. Without knowing fully or adequately what exactly the transport needs in the country are we are not in a position to discuss or dilate upon the problems of the Railways or the transport itself. Madam last year when I was speaking on the Budget I pointed out that there had been planning of some sort but within this planning there had not been sufficient planning in the functioning of the administration. There has not been planning in carrying out the various phases of the programme enunciated in the plan or in the Budget. Frequently we came across the statement by the hon’ble Minister that the Railways have not been able to fulfil certain things. I went through the pages of the Budget papers and also the speech of the Minister. I came across this significant expression. Wherever there are failures or shortfalls in performance we are told that these are mainly due to unpredictable factors or factors beyond control. I do not think that some of the factors which my hon’ble Friend would like us to believe that they are unpredictable or uncontrollable cannot be anticipated. For instance I may draw the attention of the hon’ble Minister to one important fact that is we have been supplying since some time past empty haulage for a long distance to collieries to steel factories and so on. We are told that this empty haulage is unavoidable that we have to find empty wagons to steel factories and collieries to carry raw material or perhaps coal and the like. So for a long distance we find wagons going empty but if there had been a research cell an organization in the Ministry to find out ways and means of utilising these wagons fruitfully by avoiding bottlenecks in between we could have solved the transport difficulty to a certain extent. I do not want to be told by the Minister that this is a physical impossibility. Even in the advanced countries of the world every movement of wagon coach and engine is planned before it is put into operation. It is unfortunate and tragic that in this country after a decade of planning we have not been able to think in terms of planning while executing the works. Now in regard to some of the general problems of the railways I would say first of all that the rise in demand is so great that we have to be prepared to provide not only adequate but also effective transport facilities to our people. I need not tell the House that the railway transport system in general is greatly dependent or inter-dependent on the general economy of the country. But during the last one decade there has been one significant factor that has to be appreciated that is the demand for transport is increasing at a faster rate than the rise in the national income or the rise in production in any sector or in any industry. This is a factor that has not been adequately appreciated even if it has been adequately appreciated no attempt or sincere effort has yet been made to carry out the fulfilment of the needs of all the sectors of our economy.",
31: "Madam Deputy Chairman the main question for consideration of this House is whether the increase in the passenger fares and in the freights that has been proposed by the Railway Minister should have the support of this House or not. I have been listening with some interest to the speeches so far made and they are all unanimous on one point namely that there should be no increase particularly so far as the second class passengers are concerned. What we have to decide at present is that those friends who have emphasized their opposition to this levy have also said that in view of out developing economy in view of our developing industrialisation in view of the fact that there is a greater demand for passenger traffic as well as goods traffic we have to develop our railway system. We have to see that we increase our lines. We have also to see that we double our lines. We have also to see that the production of the locomotives wagons and coaches is increased with greater rapidity. Otherwise we will not be able to meet the demand of the developing economy. It is also agreed that according to the recommendations of the Pay Commission we all feel that our workers our labourers are entitled D.A. which will be to the tune of Rs 12 crores. There are no two opinions about it. It is also demanded that so far as amenities to the workers are concerned regarding their privileges and concessions or the repairs to the stock are concerned there is very urgent need that we should see that our workers do not strain themselves. An engine driver should not be asked to do work for more than 12 hours. Similarly others in the Railways should also have further concessions so far as leisure rest and leave are concerned. It is also agreed and it has been emphatically stressed on all hands that the second class passengers are not getting amenities which they should get. The greater portion of the income comes from the second class passengers and the position is that they are not getting their dues by way of rest and comfort which are necessary for them. I appreciate that effort is being made that so far as sleeping accommodation and provision of fans to the second class passengers are concerned something is being done. But this does not touch even in fringe of the problem and when we see the second class passengers huddled together like cattle not even having sufficient air to breathe in we feel that there is something seriously wrong with our Railway Administration. We have also to see that the shortage that we had about the supply of wagons to the coal-mines and to our steel industry is not there. Madam it is a strange chain of events that the Minister who was in charge of steel and who gave statements in a way implying that the Railways are not doing their part well is now saddled with that responsibility and I am sure he must feel double responsibility because he knows how the industry has suffered or was likely to suffer. As the Minister of Steel he charged the Railway Ministry of not doing things which should have been done. So now these are the problems that we have to meet and the question arises how to meet them. I quite understand that there could be some economy effected in administration. I could also understand that by tightening the administration and seeing that there is not much of ticketless travel we could improve the position. I could also understand that by taking effective measures regarding the new responsibility which Parliament has placed on the shoulders of the Railway Department namely the liability of a common carrier for goods for which they have provided Rs. 2 crores and by having all these things in mind there could be some reduction in expenditure. But I do not think that reduction would be of a value sufficient to meet the increasing demands of the Railways. That is the problem. It is true that it will be hard to increase any fare. It would be hard to increase any freight. We do realize and we do appreciate it and as representatives of the people we do feel every day that our people are being taxed more and more. As regards freight Madam my own view is that so far as food articles are concerned this proposal should be modified just as there has been a modification in the case of giving encouragement for exports and in certain other respects. Similarly I feel that so far as food articles are concerned the proposal should be modified and on the other things these freights may continue as proposed. In this way the danger that has been pointed out by hon’ble Members and to a certain extent correctly that if the prices of food articles go up that would create difficulty would be avoided.",
32: "Mr. Vice-Chairman knowing the hon’ble Mover of this Resolution to be a good Parliamentarian. I had expected that he would place before the House all sides of this problem. I had expected that he would be no less interested in the efficiency and discipline of the Administration no less interested in the public welfare than in the interest of the civil services. But I am sorry to observe that he has taken only one view of the matter namely the interests of the civil services alone. He has not at all dwelt upon the frightful consequences which a strike of the sort we had the misfortune to have would have had on the country and the people in general. He has spoken no doubt in measured tones unlike the hon’ble Member who sat to his right in the morning and who raised a shout wanting to make up by sound what his arguments lacked in force. I wish to submit to this House that it would be incorrect and it would be imprudent for this House to accept this Resolution. It would be incorrect because by accepting this Resolution we would be laying down something bad in principle and we would also be accepting a policy which would be suicidal and which would cut at the roots of discipline in the services. To the merits of reinstatment or otherwise of these persons I will come later on. I doubt the very propriety of Parliament going into this matter. Now let us see what has happened. Whether right or wrong Departments have taken up the question of these strikers those who took part in this strike those who indulged in disobeying the ordinance; several cases of sabotage and intimidation including criminal ones have been gone into and the authorities have taken some decision. In some cases the Government have taken the decision and in some cases the Departments have taken the decision. Now would it be right for Parliament to intervene to interfere with these decisions? Suppose we do that suppose Parliament interfered with the decisions taken by the Government or by the Heads of Departments tomorrow with what face and with what authority can the Head of a Department extract service from his subordinates? This is the question which hon’ble the mover must see and also the other hon’ble Members who have spoken in support of the Resolution. Unemployment is mounting up and we have not been able to generate enough employment opportunities to provide even for those people who are entering the labour market today perhaps to the extent envisaged during the Tenth Plan. The point that I want to make is that it is not quite justifiable to take only one aspect of the Tenth plan period namely the exigencies of capital mobilization out of the context of the general economic situation in the country. When we are therefore making this huge tax effort we will have to apply our mind with equal seriousness if not more to see that the income generation in the community is as great as is envisaged so that the savings and investments could be effected without disturbing unnecessarily the consumption pattern in the community. Whenever there is any tax on corporations this cry is raised and this cry is always belied by what the industrialists themselves have claimed to be the sensitive barometer to find out the climate for capital formation. I mean the stock exchanges. This time the stock exchanges have reacted quite favourably to the Budget proposals as a whole which clearly shows that whatever else may be the merit of the present Budget proposals it is certainly not anti-capital. Last year also the stock markets boomed up after the taxation proposals were announced. This time though they were a little hesitant at first ultimately I think they have realised that there is nothing wrong with the taxation proposals and they are now merrily mounting up. This is quite natural because there are so many benefits and advantages in our economy today that it is not difficult for the corporate sector to absorb a small rise of five per cent in the corporation tax which has been proposed by the hon’ble Finance Minister. The economy of the nation today is more or less a closed economy because due to the lack of external finances imports have been virtually prohibited. There is a lot of planning in the country which makes risk-bearing rather unlikely and because of the regulation of the economy internal competition is also not very great. The risk-bearing capacity which is claimed by the industrialists really forgetting large profits and large yields on their investment is almost non-existent in our economy today. Our markets are expanding very fast and the money generated is much more than the production of commodities with the result that there are shortages is almost every commodity. It should not be difficult for the industrialist to absorb the small rise of five percent in the corporate tax.",
33: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir the Plantations Labour Bill 1973 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on the 6th March 1973. Then it was referred to a Joint Committee of both the Houses and this Joint Committee submitted its report in 1975. Now we are discussing this Bill today after six years of the submission of the report by the Joint Committee. Hence the Bill would not be able to deal with the present day expectations of the workers of the plantations. The original Act in regard to the plantation labour namely the Act of 1951 itself provided various welfare measures for the plantation labor. But unfortunately the planters non-chalantly violated all these provisions for welfare measures. The main question therefore is the question of implementation of the provisions of the Act. Mere amendments will not improve the position. There is no provision in the present Bill also as to how these measures these provisions can be implemented and what the Government is thinking in terms of implementing these provisions. In most cases even the Government officials who are deputed for the purpose of inspecting the gardens they themselves side with the planters. If Government officers themselves side with the planters where is the remedy? Hence we should devise ways and means and adopt measures so that the provisions which are made in the Act and the Bill the present Bill are implemented properly. Sir the provisions in the present Bill fall far short of the expectations of the working population in the plantations. In the present Bill it has been suggested that the acreage of the plantations in regard to which this Act will be applied will be reduced to 5 hectares. But this is also not sufficient because under this also the owners the planters will take shelter and many of the plantations will still remain uncovered. This should be further reduced to 2.5 hectares. So far as compensation for house collapse is concerned it has been said here that if the occupant of a house is directly responsible for the collapse he will not be entitled to compensation. Under this provision Sir the employers will take shelter and deprive many workers of getting compensation. Sir it is known to everybody that the plantation industry is the biggest foreign exchange earning industry. The productivity of this industry in India can increase only if the labour are contended. Contended labour alone can improve the efficiency and productivity of the plantation industry. So the need of the hour is not to bring such piecemeal legislation. What is needed today is a comprehensive Bill which should deal with all aspects of the working conditions of the plantation labour. The need of the day is to introduce such a Bill where workers will have full participation in managing the gardens and this plantation industry should be nationalised immediately. Sir Assam is one of the most important tea producing States in the country. There formerly the tea gardens were owned by the Britishers. Now the Indians have purchased those gardens. After these gardens have gone to the hands of the Indian planters the situation has not improved; rather it has deteriorated the efficiency of the gardens has deteriorated. Even the local people and educated tea labour youths are being deprived of getting employment in the gardens. Therefore steps should immediately be taken to nationalise this industry. Here Sir I would like to inform the House that in 1978-79 the rulling Janata Party in the Assam Assembly had adopted a resolution unanimously for nationalisation of tea industry in Assam. If the Government is not willing to nationalise the entire plantation industry I would request that the Government should take early steps at least to nationalise the tea industry in Assam. It is a very vital matter for the economic self-sufficiency of Assam State and it is very important from the point of view of increasing efficiency and productivity of the gardens also. I would like the Government not only to pass this Amendment Bill which I have risen to support but also to ensure its implementation as best as it can; otherwise getting it passes and keeping a copy of it in the library or elsewhere will not improve the conditions of the plantation workers. I want proper implementation proper enforcement of the law and I want that desired amenities and facilities should be provided to these workers and it should be ensured that employers do provide these amenities. When this question of Joint Committee was taken up in this House our late friend Mr. Bhupesh Gupta was there and he also voiced his feelings and said that these plantations should be acquired by the Government. These are generally foreign-owned establishments and they are the centres –at least in Assam –of anti-Indian activities. These plantations deserve to be taken over by the Government as early as possible.",
34: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir I would like to speak on this Bill in the interest of the rapid economic growth in the country. If the nation grows from strength to strength economically leading to eradication of the degrading and disheartening poverty of the people of India the workers of this nation would also benefit and they would also go above the poverty line. Sir I would like to mention here that the plantation crops as understood by the term so far namely coffee rubber tea and cardamom have been giving this nation substantial amount of the much-coveted foreign exchange annually. It must be noted that coffee exports alone have given our country during the last five years over Rs. 1000 crores in foreign exchange by way of export earnings and export duties. I must also bring to the attention of this House that the famed tea industry in India today has become a sick industry affecting lakhs of workers and the tea planters. Sir we ought to know that in the agricultural sector the plantation labour is the best organised one and is getting nearly the same treatment facilities and amenities like the industrial labour. Sir coming from a plantation district of Karnataka I sincerely agree that the welfare measures provided in the Act must be faithfully implemented and strictly enforced. But I cannot subscribe to the view taken by some that the planters generally are exploiters and are inimical to the interests of their own workers and that they must be dealt with severly. Sir most of the planters of today are educated and they know that contended labour is conducive to productivity and peace in the estates and therefore would like to provide all the welfare measures and amenities to the workers. Sir I would like to point out some of the very draconian discriminatory and invidious urban-directed amendments made in the Plantations Labour (Amendment) Bill 1973. Sir the Plantations Labour Act is sought to be applied now even to holdings of 5 hectares and above employing 15 persons and more. Originally in the Bill brought before the Joint Committee it was sought to be applied to holdings of 6.5 hectares and above. It would be realistic to make an amendment to the present Bill to raise the size of holdings from five hectares to 6.5 hectares. Sir we must bear in mind the economic viability of small plantations of 5 hectares and the financial capacity of the small planters to fulfil the obligations cast on them to provide housing and crèche facilities. Those small planters in some cases are unable to provide themselves with houses and medical care as good as those intended for their workers in the Bill. I am sure that good many small holdings will go into liquidation unable to bear the burden when the prices fall as in the case of tea today. I would emphatically say that Clause 13 is not only Draconian but discriminatory. And it is most harsh and killing to the farming community of India whose hands feed and clothe the people –poor and rich. Sir I strongly feel that the punishment with both compulsory fine and imprisonment is too serve for violation of a welfare legislation covered by the Act. For economic reasons and financial incapacity the debt- ridden employer particularly a small holder may be unable to discharge the obligation such as providing type-design houses creches medical facilities etc. In such cases there is no point in sending the landholder to jail and collecting a fine from him for every day of default. The relevant provisions in the Bill are made more stringent than the Factories Act under which in the case of a further offence the court is given the discretion to punish the defaulting employer. But in the proposed amendment the word used is ‘shall’ instead of ‘may’ which makes it mandatory on the court to impose imprisonment as well as fine. These provisions are too harsh and discriminatory particularly in view of the fact that the Bill seeks to bring in farms of five hectares which are in the nature of peasant holdings under the scope of the Act. Sir I would like to ask the Government of the people for the people and by the people in the name of the farmers of India why it wants to treat a farmer as a criminal and to be imprisoned for such an offence while it does not do so for a factory owner of a city? By making this comparison I do not mean that a provision should be made in the relevant Factories Act to make the sentence of imprisonment compulsory for similar offences. Let me make it clear that I am not speaking against the interests of the workers in the plantation. I am only speaking against the stringent and invidious measures which have been provided in the Bill affecting the rural employers and the invidious laws enacted for them.",
35: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir I welcome the Budget proposals for the year 1982-83 which are all comprehensive and which embrace most of the development plans that we have envisaged for the establishment of a socialistic society in this country. In spite of the taxation and the introduction of fresh duties we find that the Finance Minister has succeeded in disturbing only a microscopic section of the people of this country to extract sufficient funds for our schemes. The Finance Minister has also succeeded in finding funds for almost all the development plans of this country which will add to our good. While we discuss the general aspects of the Budget we will have to consider the activities of most of the sections that are now covered in the Budget. Even though the provisions are there I think Sir the expenditure on some of the activities envisaged in the Budget should be subjected to a thorough scrutiny. In this respect Sir I wish to bring to the notice of this House the special feature of the educational system of this country. Some of the members have mentioned something about the educational system of this country have remarked that the allocation of funds is not adequate and that the provision should be revised according to the needs of this country. As the hon’ble Member was speaking in Hindi I did not thoroughly understand what he meant but still Sir the educational system has created a sort of confusion in our country over the last fifteen years and every now and then we had been changing the schemes and plans for educating our children and various States have adopted different schemes which have actually created a feeling of disintegration among the people of this country. In some of the States they have switched on to the regional language as the medium of instruction and in some States they think that English should be retained as the medium of instruction. But the people believe that is the national language of our country. But Sir the time is not yet ripe for us to switch on to Hindi. So as and when we find it feasible we may switch on to our national language but till that time we will keep English as the medium of instruction in all educational institutions. Sir the other day the University Grants Commission submitted a report wherein they have mentioned that English should be the medium of instruction at least in the colleges. Sir it is my opinion that English should be retained in this country for years to come till we find that we could translate all the essential books books on science and technology etc. into Hindi which should be able to help us in educating our boys especially in the technical institutions through Hindi as the medium. Here Sir some of the Members have pointed out with regard to the introduction of different types of education in the same State or in various parts of this country. We find that a majority of the children of our country are educated in the basic system which brings out as far as I know second class citizens in this country who are to be governed by the boys who are sent to the public schools. Most of the children of the ‘haves’ are sent to the public schools and they are imparted expert training and when they come out they are definitely superior to those boys who undergo this basic system of education. If this basic education is considered to be the best for the development of our country in the socialistic way we will have somehow or other to find some better means of imparting education whereby they will be able to compete with the students who are now undergoing training in the public schools. Unless we do it we will be creating as I previously mentioned a second class of citizens in this country. I hope the authorities who are concerned with the planning of education in this country will review their schemes according to the suggestions that I have put forth now. In the game way Sir our country is mainly depending on our agriculture and industries for the development of our economy. But the agriculturists are an ignorant section of our people who do not find in spite of the development in that sector of our economy of high production a better income as the industrial section is having in this country. The industrial section is fast improving and their standard of living has gone high. At the same time in spite of the better production in the agricultural section the agrarian population has not come at par with the industrial section of this country. In the same way industrial labourers are organised. Most of them are given so many benefits and advantages according to the legislation that is passed for the betterment of industrial labourers of this country.",
